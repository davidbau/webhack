## Before You Read Further

You are holding (or more likely scrolling through) a guide to the
Mazes of Menace, the vast and ever-shifting dungeon complex that sits
beneath a place the locals just call "the dungeon entrance." What lies
below is one of the oldest and most treacherous adventure destinations
in existence: dozens of levels of corridors, vaults, and special
chambers, stretching from the relatively tame upper mines all the way
down to the molten depths of Gehennom and beyond.

People have been descending into these depths for decades. Most of them
died. The ones who made it back brought stories, and some of those
stories eventually got written down. You're reading the latest edition
of that accumulated lore.

**A word of caution.** This guide will change how you experience the
Mazes forever. Once you know that a floating eye can paralyze you with
a glance, you can never un-know it. Once you learn what a cockatrice
corpse can do when wielded with gloves, the dungeon becomes a
different place. Some adventurers prefer the thrill of discovery over
the comfort of preparation. If that's you, close this guide now and
go learn things the hard way. There is real joy in that.

**Looking for the manual instead?** If you're just looking for game
commands, item lists, and mechanics without spoilers, you want the
[Guide to the Mazes of Menace](../guidebook/) instead. That's the reference
manual that comes with the game. This document is a *strategic* guide —
it assumes you already know how to play and want to know how to
*survive*.

But if you've died to one too many rubber-banded acid blobs, or you're
tired of starving on dungeon level four because you didn't know you
could pray — read on. We'll do our best to keep you alive.

## Part One: Before You Set Out

### Choosing Your Expedition

The first decision you'll make, before you even set foot on the
stairs, is who you are. In the Mazes, this means three things: your
**role**, your **race**, and your **alignment**. Together, these
determine your starting equipment, your natural abilities, which gods
hear your prayers, and which artifacts you can safely handle.

Don't agonize over this choice too much on your first few trips. You
will die regardless, and each death teaches something. But if you'd
like a recommendation for a first expedition, read on.

#### The Roles

There are thirteen roles available to adventurers. Each comes with
different starting equipment, different intrinsic abilities gained at
various experience levels, and a different quest to complete in the
mid-game.

**Archeologist.** You start with a bullwhip, a pickaxe, and a tinning
kit. The pickaxe is quietly one of the best starting items in the
game: it lets you dig through walls and create your own escape routes from
the very first level. The tinning kit lets you preserve corpses for
later. Archeologists are capable and flexible, though a bit fragile in
early combat. You begin knowing what all gems are, which is a nice
parlor trick and occasionally useful for unicorn negotiation.
*Alignment: Lawful or Neutral.*

**Barbarian.** You start strong. Literally. A two-handed sword and
good starting strength mean you can hack through early monsters with
ease. The downside is that two-handed weapons prevent you from using a
shield, and Barbarians are not known for their finesse. You do get
poison resistance from the start, which saves you from several common
early deaths. A straightforward role for players who like straightforward
solutions. *Alignment: Neutral or Chaotic.*

**Cave Dweller.** You start primitive but tough, with a club and
some rocks for throwing. You gain speed early and your hit dice are
generous. The Cave Dweller's simplicity is a virtue: fewer tools
means fewer things to manage. *Alignment: Lawful or Neutral.*

**Healer.** You begin with a stethoscope, healing potions, and poison
resistance. The stethoscope is remarkable: it lets you check a
monster's hit points and your own internal state. Healers are fragile
fighters, but their medical knowledge keeps them alive through
situations that would kill other roles. You can also see whether
potions of sickness are safe, which streamlines identification
considerably. *Alignment: Neutral.*

**Knight.** You start mounted on a pony, which is both a blessing
and a liability. The pony is a decent combatant early on but will get
you into trouble if it wanders into a shop. Knights follow a code of
conduct that penalizes attacking fleeing or peaceful monsters. You get
a lance for jousting from horseback, which is very effective when it
works. *Alignment: Lawful.*

**Monk.** You fight best with bare hands and start with no weapon at
all, which is the point. Monks gain martial arts abilities as they
level, eventually becoming formidable unarmed combatants. You start
with sleep resistance and see invisible, and you should avoid eating
meat if you want to maintain your spiritual discipline. One of the
more unusual roles, rewarding for experienced players.
*Alignment: Any.*

**Priest.** You start with holy (or unholy) water and the ability to
intuitively sense whether items are blessed, cursed, or uncursed. This
is enormously useful. You know immediately whether that cloak you just
found is safe to wear. Priests are competent fighters with access to
clerical spells and begin with a mace. *Alignment: Any (matches your
god).*

**Ranger.** You start with a bow and a generous supply of arrows,
making you one of the strongest ranged combatants early on. Rangers
get stealth and see invisible early. Your elven racial option gives
you sleep resistance on top of that. If you enjoy picking off enemies
from a distance, this is your role. *Alignment: Neutral or Chaotic.*

**Rogue.** You start with a short sword, daggers for throwing, and a
sack. You get stealth from the beginning and your backstab ability
deals extra damage when you attack from hiding. Rogues are excellent
at avoiding trouble, which is often better than being good at
surviving it. *Alignment: Chaotic.*

**Samurai.** You start with a katana, which is one of the better
one-handed weapons in the game, plus a wakizashi backup and a yumi
bow with arrows. Samurai get speed early and have a strong martial
kit overall. The katana's damage output carries you through the
early game with ease. *Alignment: Lawful.*

**Tourist.** You start with a Hawaiian shirt, a credit card, a camera,
and a truly absurd number of darts. Tourists are deliberately designed
to be the hardest role in the game. Your starting equipment is mostly
a joke, your combat abilities are poor, and the dungeon seems to know
it. That said, the darts are actually useful for training ranged
skills, and the camera can blind monsters in a pinch. A role for
people who have ascended before and want a challenge.
*Alignment: Neutral.*

**Valkyrie.** You start with a spear, a small shield, and cold
resistance. Valkyries are widely considered one of the most
beginner-friendly roles: strong combat stats, good starting equipment,
and cold resistance covers one of the more common damage types. If
you're lawful, you can find a long sword and dip it in a fountain at
experience level 5 or higher for a chance at Excalibur. (In older
editions, Valkyries started with a long sword, making this easier.)
This is the recommendation for your first serious attempt.
*Alignment: Lawful or Neutral. Female only.*

**Wizard.** You start with a quarterstaff and a spellbook or two. Your
physical combat is terrible, but you have access to the deepest magic
in the game. Wizards are extremely powerful in the late game but very
fragile early on. You'll lean heavily on your spells and need to find
ways to avoid melee combat until you're strong enough to dominate it.
If you enjoy resource management and creative problem-solving, the
Wizard is deeply satisfying. *Alignment: Neutral or Chaotic.*

#### The Races

Your race affects your starting attributes, maximum attributes, and
which intrinsics you begin with or can gain.

**Human.** You know what a human is. No infravision, no poison
resistance, no particular talents. On the bright side, every role is
open to you, and nobody in the dungeon singles you out for being one.
Perfectly serviceable.

**Dwarf.** Dwarves are sturdy and strong, with infravision (they can
see warm-blooded creatures in the dark). They're good fighters and
have an affinity for mining. Available for: Archeologist, Cave Dweller,
Valkyrie.

**Elf.** Elves get sleep resistance, infravision, and a natural
affinity for bows. They're a bit more fragile than humans but have
excellent dexterity. Available for: Ranger, Wizard.

**Gnome.** Gnomes get infravision and are comfortable underground.
They're small but resourceful. Available for: Archeologist, Cave
Dweller, Healer, Ranger, Wizard.

**Orc.** Orcs get infravision and poison resistance, which is genuinely
useful. They tend to have high strength but low charisma. The trade-off
is that some shopkeepers are less friendly. Available for: Barbarian,
Ranger, Rogue, Wizard.

#### Alignment

Your alignment (Lawful, Neutral, or Chaotic) determines which gods
you worship, which artifacts you can safely use, and how certain
actions affect your standing. It's tempting to think of these as
"good," "balanced," and "evil," but it's more nuanced than that.

The key thing to understand about alignment is that it's a number.
Every action that matches your alignment's expectations increases it;
actions that violate your alignment's code decrease it. Your alignment
record affects your relationship with your god, which in turn affects
whether prayer will save you or smite you.

**Lawful** characters should avoid attacking peaceful creatures and
should never murder. Sacrifice frequently at co-aligned altars.
Lawful has the advantage of access to Excalibur, one of the best
weapons in the game, obtainable as early as experience level 5.

**Neutral** characters have the most flexibility. You can get away
with more than a Lawful character, but your god still frowns on
truly chaotic behavior. Neutral has access to some excellent quest
artifacts.

**Chaotic** characters can kill with relative impunity but should
avoid pious behavior that doesn't match their dark patron's
expectations. Chaotic is often paired with Rogue for thematic
consistency.

For your first game: **Lawful Valkyrie, Human or Dwarf.** Strong
combat, cold resistance, and a path to Excalibur once you find a
long sword. It's the closest thing to an easy mode the Mazes offer,
which is to say it's still very hard.

### What to Pack

Any good travel guide will tell you what to bring. Ours has the
awkward job of telling you that you don't get to choose. Your
starting kit is determined by your role, and you'll descend with
whatever your role provides, no more.

What you *can* choose is what to prioritize once you're down there.
Every role starts with equipment suited to its strengths. The
important thing isn't what's in your pack on turn one; it's knowing
what to scavenge from the first few levels to shore up your
weaknesses.

#### The Early Shopping List

No matter your role, here's what you should be looking for:

**A source of nutrition.** You will get hungry. It happens faster than
you think. Food rations are the gold standard: 800 nutrition each,
they never spoil. Grab every food ration you see. If you're a role
that starts with tripe rations, those are fine for your pet but
genuinely unpleasant for you. Eat them only if you must.

**A way to identify things.** In the early game, your primary
identification tools are altars (drop items to see if they flash
blessed/cursed), your pet (it won't step on cursed items), and
experimentation. A scroll of identify is valuable, but you might not
find one for a while. A touchstone (a gray stone that identifies gems)
is helpful but not urgent.

**Armor improvements.** Whatever you're wearing, you can probably do
better. Look for cloaks, helmets, gloves, and boots to fill empty
equipment slots. Even basic items like a helmet or pair of gloves
provide armor class benefits and can protect against specific attacks.

**A ranged attack.** Daggers, darts, or a bow with arrows. Fighting
from range is almost always safer than melee, and some monsters (like
floating eyes) should never be fought in melee at all.

**A light source.** Many areas of the dungeon are dark, and bumbling
around blind is a recipe for walking into things you'd rather see
coming. An oil lamp or magic lamp is ideal. A candle or two will do
in a pinch.

**Restraint.** New adventurers pick up everything they find. Veterans
pick up everything they need. The difference is about forty pounds
and the ability to outrun a gnome lord. If your status line reads
"Burdened," you're carrying someone else's inventory too.

---

### Your First Descent

You step down the stairs. The air is cool and damp. A corridor
stretches before you, branching into darkness. Your pet (a little dog
or kitten, depending on your inclinations) trots along behind you.

Welcome to the dungeon.

The first few levels of the Mazes are designed to ease you in, which
is a relative term. Monsters are weaker, but you are too. Your gear is
minimal, your hit points are low, and you don't yet have the
resistances that make the mid-game survivable. More experienced
adventurers will tell you that levels one through five are where the
most characters die, not because the threats are the greatest, but
because you have the fewest resources to deal with them.

#### The Golden Rules of Early Survival

**Rule 1: Don't fight what you can't beat.** This sounds obvious, but
it's the single most violated principle in the Mazes. If a monster is
too tough for you, walk away. Use corridors as chokepoints. Funnel
enemies so you fight them one at a time. If you stumble into a room
full of monsters, step back into the corridor and force them to come
to you in single file.

```
  Bad: fighting in the open        Good: corridor chokepoint

  ┌─────·──────┐                   ┌─────·──────┐
  │·Z··Z·······│                   │·Z···Z······│
  │··Z·@·Z·Z···│                   │··Z··Z······│
  │····Z·······│                   │·Z··········+##@
  │··Z·········│                   │··Z·········│
  └────────────┘                   └────────────┘

  You're surrounded.               They come to you one at a time.
```

**Rule 2: Don't eat things you don't understand.** Monster corpses
can grant powerful intrinsics, or they can poison you, give you food
poisoning, or worse. Until you know what a corpse does, leave it on
the ground. The exceptions: you can always safely eat food rations,
lembas wafers, cram rations, and fruits. Lichen corpses are safe and
never rot. Lizard corpses are safe, never rot, and cure
petrification. Always carry one if you can.

**Rule 3: Your pet is your friend.** Your starting pet is more useful
than it appears. It will fight alongside you, pick up items (which
tells you they're not cursed, since pets avoid cursed items on the ground),
and can even be trained to steal from shops. Keep it fed by dropping
tripe rations or corpses near it. A healthy, well-fed pet is one of
your best early assets.

**Rule 4: Learn to pray.** If you are about to die (hit points
critically low, starving, turning to stone) you
can pray to your god for help. In the early game, with decent
alignment, prayer will almost certainly save you. But you can only
pray about once every 300-500 turns, and praying at the wrong time
(when your god is angry, when you're in Gehennom, or when you've
prayed too recently) can make things much worse. Think of prayer as an
emergency button with a cooldown. Don't waste it on minor problems.
We'll cover the details in [Divine Relations](#divine-relations).

**Rule 5: Explore thoroughly but move purposefully.** Every turn you
spend in the dungeon costs nutrition. If you stand around for hundreds
of turns, you'll starve. But rushing past rooms means missing
items you need. The sweet spot is to explore each level fairly
completely (check rooms, open doors, look for hidden passages) but
don't grind. When you've found what the level has to offer, move on.

#### Things That Kill You (And How Not to Let Them)

Here's a short list of common early deaths and how to prevent them:

**Starvation.** Eat when you're Hungry (the status message), not
when you're Weak or Fainting. If you're Fainting, pray immediately.
Pick up every food ration you find.

**Floating eyes.** They're the `e` on the map. Small, blue, and
seemingly harmless. If you hit one in melee, you'll be paralyzed, and
every monster in the vicinity will take free shots at your frozen body.
Use ranged attacks, or just walk around them. They don't pursue you.

**Rotted corpses.** If you eat a corpse that's been on the ground too
long, you'll get food poisoning, which is lethal without treatment.
Eat corpses fresh (within a few turns of the kill) or not at all.
If you do get food poisoning, pray immediately.

**Falling down stairs while overburdened.** If you're carrying too
much, taking the stairs can cause you to tumble and take significant
damage. Drop items before descending, or manage your inventory.

**Killer bees.** They come in swarms, they're fast, and in the early
game, a group of them can overwhelm you. If you see one bee, expect
more. Use a corridor to fight them one at a time.

**Your own pet.** If your pet is between you and a narrow corridor,
you might accidentally swap places with it repeatedly instead of
moving. Worse, if you attack it (because you got confused or forgot
it was there), you lose alignment and trust. Be aware of where your
pet is.

### The Lay of the Land

The Mazes are procedurally generated. No two visits are quite the
same. But the dungeon follows patterns, and understanding those
patterns is the first step toward navigating them effectively.

#### The Big Picture

Before we talk about what the symbols mean, here's the overall
shape of the place. The dungeon is a branching tree with a main
trunk (the Dungeons of Doom) and several side branches. The
diagram nearby shows the full layout. Knowing where you are in this
tree helps you plan your route and know what's coming.

The **Dungeons of Doom** form the upper half, roughly levels 1
through 27. Along the way you'll find branches leading to the
**Gnomish Mines** (luckstone, shops), **Sokoban** (a prize at the
top), your **Quest** (your role's special dungeon), and optionally
**Fort Ludios** (a vault full of gold). The main trunk ends at
**The Castle**, which guards the entrance to Gehennom.

**Gehennom** is the lower half: maze levels, demon lords, and
the ultimate objective — the **Amulet of Yendor** at the very
bottom in Moloch's Sanctum. Once you have it, you climb all the
way back up and pass through the **Elemental Planes** to reach
the **Astral Plane**, where your god awaits your offering.

```
  Dungeons of Doom (levels 1-29ish)
    │
    ├── The Gnomish Mines (branch around level 2-4)
    │     ├── Minetown (shops and a temple)
    │     └── Mine's End (bottom: luckstone)
    │
    ├── Sokoban (branch around level 5-9, goes UP)
    │     └── Top: bag of holding or amulet of reflection
    │
    ├── Your Quest (portal around level 11-16)
    │     └── Unique to your role. Get your quest artifact.
    │
    ├── Fort Ludios (portal, if you find it)
    │     └── A vault full of gold and soldiers
    │
    ├── Medusa's Island (level ~25)
    │
    └── The Castle (level ~27, bottom of Dungeons of Doom)
          │
  Gehennom (levels 28-50ish)
    │
    ├── Vlad's Tower (contains the Candelabrum)
    │
    ├── The Wizard's Tower (Wizard of Yendor, Book of the Dead)
    │
    └── Moloch's Sanctum (bottom: the Amulet of Yendor)
          │
          (now go ALL the way back up)
          │
          The Elemental Planes
            Earth ─► Air ─► Fire ─► Water
              │
              The Astral Plane (three altars, pick the right one)
                │
                ASCENSION
```

The typical trip: go down through the Dungeons, detour into the
Mines for a luckstone and Minetown's shops, clear Sokoban for a
prize, do your Quest, reach the Castle, descend through Gehennom
to get the Amulet, then climb all the way back up and through the
Planes. Simple enough on paper. Surviving it is another matter.

#### The Map Symbols

Everything in the dungeon is represented by a symbol on the screen.
Learning to read these symbols quickly is important:

| Symbol   | Meaning                       |
| -------- | ----------------------------- |
| `.`      | Floor (room)                  |
| `#`      | Corridor                      |
| `-`  `│` | Wall (horizontal, vertical)   |
| `+`      | Closed door (or spellbook)    |
| `<`      | Stairs up                     |
| `>`      | Stairs down                   |
| `{`      | Fountain                      |
| `_`      | Altar                         |
| `\`      | Throne                        |
| `#`      | Sink (in a kitchen)           |
| `^`      | Trap (once revealed)          |
| `@`      | You (or a human-type monster) |

Letters represent monsters: `d` for dogs, `D` for dragons, `Z` for
zombies. Colors help distinguish within a class: a red `D` is a red
dragon, while a gray `D` is a gray dragon. We'll cover this in detail
in [A Field Guide to Dungeon Fauna](#a-field-guide-to-dungeon-fauna).

Item symbols are punctuation marks:

| Symbol | Item Class         |
| ------ | ------------------ |
| `)`    | Weapons            |
| `[`    | Armor              |
| `%`    | Food (comestibles) |
| `!`    | Potions            |
| `?`    | Scrolls            |
| `/`    | Wands              |
| `=`    | Rings              |
| `"`    | Amulets            |
| `(`    | Tools              |
| `+`    | Spellbooks         |
| `*`    | Gems and stones    |
| `$`    | Gold               |

#### Room Types

Most rooms in the dungeon are ordinary, empty or with a few items
and monsters scattered about. But some rooms are special:

```
   A shop:                 A zoo:                 A throne room:
   ┌───────┐               ┌────────┐             ┌────────┐
   │··[·?!·│               │Z··Z$Z··│             │··Z·Z·Z·│
   │···@···│               │$Z···$Z·│             │·Z·\··Z·│
   │!··)·/·│               │·Z$Z··Z$│             │··Z·Z···│
   └──+────┘               └───+────┘             └───+────┘
       #                       #                      #
   @ = shopkeeper          Z = sleeping           \ = throne
   Items for sale.         $ = gold piles         Monsters guard.
```

**Shops.** Identified by the shopkeeper standing in the doorway (or
inside). Shops sell items of a particular type: general
stores, armor shops, weapon shops, scroll shops, potion shops, and
more. Items on the shop floor belong to the shopkeeper; pick one up
and you'll be quoted a price. You can sell items too. Shopkeepers are
extremely powerful in combat, so don't steal unless you have a plan.

**Temples.** A room with an altar and a priest or priestess tending
it. The altar's alignment matters: if it matches yours, you can
sacrifice here for good effects. If it doesn't, the resident priest
won't be friendly about your attempts.

**Throne rooms.** A room with a throne (`\`) and usually surrounded
by monsters. Sitting on the throne has random effects, sometimes
wonderful, sometimes terrible. See
[Points of Interest](#points-of-interest).

**Zoos.** A room packed with sleeping monsters and gold. If you open
the door, they all wake up. Fight from the doorway and pick them off
one at a time.

**Barracks.** A room full of soldiers. They're organized and armed,
but they're also carrying good equipment. Worth clearing if you can
handle the fight.

**Beehives.** A room full of killer bees and royal jelly. The bees
are dangerous in numbers, but royal jelly is excellent food.

**Themed rooms.** Newer editions of the dungeon include a variety
of themed rooms: collections of specific monster types, item caches,
and environmental setups. These are too varied to catalog completely
here, but they add welcome variety to the standard layout.

Not everything interesting in the dungeon is trying to kill you.
Scattered throughout the levels are fixtures that reward the
curious—and occasionally punish them. Learning what to do (and what
*not* to do) with each of these is a rite of passage.

#### Fountains `{`

Ah, fountains. That gentle bubbling sound has lured more adventurers
to their doom than any trap. Every experienced player has a fountain
story—the time they summoned a water demon on dungeon level 3, the
time they quaffed and got a wish, the time snakes poured out of
the basin.

**Quaffing from a fountain** is a slot machine with these reels:

| Outcome         | Effect                                                |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Wish granted    | A water demon appears and grants a wish (rare, ~1/30) |
| Water demon     | A hostile water demon appears                         |
| Healing         | You regain hit points                                 |
| Attribute boost | A random attribute increases                          |
| Attribute loss  | A random attribute decreases                          |
| Water moccasin  | Snakes appear                                         |
| See invisible   | You gain the ability to see invisible creatures       |
| Nothing         | "The water is cool and refreshing"                    |

Most of the time, nothing happens. Sometimes something wonderful
happens. And sometimes a water demon appears and reminds you that
curiosity has a body count.

**Dipping in a fountain** is a different gamble, and one that Lawful
characters should know by heart. If you're at least experience level
5, dipping a long sword may transform it into Excalibur—one of the
finest weapons in the dungeon. Knights get a generous 1/6 chance per
dip; everyone else gets a meager 1/30. Otherwise, dipping can rust
your gear, summon hostile water creatures, or occasionally bless
the dipped item.

The conventional wisdom: if you're a lawful Knight carrying a long
sword, dip in every fountain you see until Excalibur appears. Other
lawful characters should try too, but pack patience. And if you're
not lawful? Walk past the fountain. It has nothing for you but wet
boots and regret.

#### Altars `_`

If fountains are slot machines, altars are the single most useful
piece of furniture in the dungeon. Treat every altar like the
treasure it is.

**Dropping items on an altar** reveals their BUC status instantly:
- **Amber flash** → blessed
- **Black flash** → cursed
- No flash → uncursed

This is free, unlimited, and works on everything. In the early game,
your first altar becomes your testing laboratory—haul every
suspicious piece of gear there before putting it on. Many promising
ascensions have been saved by the simple discipline of altar-testing
before wearing.

**Sacrificing monster corpses on an altar** deepens your relationship
with your god. The corpse must be fresh (stale sacrifices are an
insult) and the bigger the monster, the more your god is impressed.
Sacrifice enough and your deity may reward you with an artifact
weapon aligned to your cause. See [Divine Relations](#divine-relations)
for the full theology.

**Converting an altar** to your alignment is possible by offering a
same-race sacrifice on an altar of a different alignment. It's a
grisly business—but useful when the dungeon gives you an altar to
the wrong god.

#### Thrones `\`

Sitting on a throne is the purest gamble in NetHack. The list of
possible outcomes reads like a wish list shuffled with a hit list:

- A wish (if your luck is positive)
- Genocide of a monster class
- Free identification of items in your pack
- A stat boost—or a stat drain
- An electric shock
- Full healing
- A crowd of hostile monsters, summoned for your amusement
- Confusion
- A curse on one of your items
- Magic mapping of the level
- See invisible
- All your gold, vanished

About one time in three, something happens, but you won't know which
column of the ledger it's going to hit. Sit on a throne when you're
strong enough to survive the worst row of that table, and ideally
when your luck is positive (for a shot at the wish). Even when
nothing happens, the throne may vanish in a puff of logic, so
you might get several tries or none at all. (Vlad's throne in
the Tower is special: it never vanishes without granting a wish
first.)
<!-- Throne mechanics: src/sit.c throne_sit_effect(), rnd(6)>4 for 1/3
     activation, rnd(13) for effect, !rn2(3) for vanishing.
     Vlad's throne: special_throne_effect(), cases 1-4 grant wish and
     destroy throne, cases 5-13 are negative but throne survives. -->

#### Sinks `#`

Sinks are the dungeon's most underrated identification tool, hiding
in plain sight in kitchen-themed rooms.

- **Kicking a sink** can shake loose a ring (useful!), summon a
  black pudding (terrifying!), or just stub your toe. Worth a kick
  in the early game if you can handle what comes out
- **Dropping a ring down a sink** produces a message unique to the
  ring type—"The water flow seems greater" for a ring of gain
  constitution, for example. This is one of the most reliable
  non-magical identification methods for rings
- **Pouring potions down a sink** (by dipping) produces telltale
  effects: a polymorph potion transforms the sink into a fountain,
  an oil potion leaves a film on the basin. A clever way to narrow
  down potion identities without risking a sip
- **Quaffing from a sink** mostly produces minor effects, but
  occasionally yields something interesting. It's the least
  rewarding interaction

### Branches and Landmarks

The branch diagram we showed earlier gives the shape of the dungeon,
but it doesn't tell you what to actually do when you arrive. Here's
a more practical tour, in roughly the order you'll visit these places.

#### The Gnomish Mines

The entrance appears somewhere around dungeon levels 2 through 4, as
a downward staircase. You'll know you're in the Mines because the
walls become rough stone and the corridors get irregular.

The Mines are populated primarily by gnomes, dwarves, and the
occasional dwarf lord. If you're playing a gnomish character, most
of them will be peaceful, which makes the Mines a relatively
comfortable detour. Everyone else will need to fight through a
modest but steady stream of hostile gnomes.

**Minetown** appears a few levels into the Mines. Usually it's a small
settlement with shops and a temple, and it's worth visiting early.
The shops let you sell unwanted items for gold and buy useful gear.
The temple has an altar (check the alignment) and a resident priest.
If the altar matches your alignment, you've found a safe place to
identify items by dropping them on it.

One in seven times, however, Minetown generates as **Orcish Town**:
an overrun settlement with no shops, no priest, and iron bars blocking
the entrances. There's still an unaligned altar, but you won't get
any shopping done. If you were counting on Minetown for early commerce,
this is a rude surprise.

Watch out for the Minetown watch (when it exists). The guards are
peaceful unless you steal from a shop or attack a peaceful creature.
If you anger them, they'll call for reinforcements.

**Mine's End** is the bottom of the Mines. One of its level variants
contains a guaranteed luckstone, which you very much want. A
luckstone in your open inventory prevents your luck from timing out
toward zero, which affects everything from combat to fountain wishes.
Grab it and carry it for the rest of the game.

#### Sokoban

The entrance appears somewhere around dungeon levels 5 through 9,
and it goes up. Sokoban is a set of four puzzle levels where you
push boulders onto holes or into place to open a path. No teleport
works here, and you can't dig through the floors.

The puzzles are fixed (two variants per level, randomly chosen).
Each level has exactly one correct solution. If you push a boulder
into a corner where it blocks your progress, you're stuck and will
need to start the level over. The game won't warn you about this.

The prize at the top is either a **bag of holding** or an
**amulet of reflection**, both extremely valuable. In current
editions, which prize you get is weighted by the level variant
(one variant favors the bag, the other the amulet, but either can
appear in either). A cursed scroll of scare monster is also placed
under the prize. A bag of holding lets you carry far more inventory
at reduced weight. An amulet of reflection bounces ray attacks back
at their casters. Either one is worth the detour.

One important rule: the Sokoban levels penalize you for "cheating."
Breaking or polymorphing boulders, reading scrolls of earth, or
squeezing past boulders costs you a point of luck each time. Solve
each level honestly if you can.
For complete solutions to all eight level variants, see
[Sokoban Solutions](#sokoban-solutions) in the appendices.

#### The Quest

Around dungeon levels 11 through 16, you'll find a magic portal to
your Quest. But you can't enter it immediately. You need to be at
least experience level 14, and you need to have spoken to your quest
leader (who appears on the first Quest level). The leader sends you
to retrieve your role's quest artifact from a quest nemesis.

Each role has a unique Quest with unique maps, a unique nemesis, and
a unique artifact reward. The Valkyrie hunts the Orb of Fate. The
Wizard retrieves the Eye of the Aethiopica. The Tourist battles the
Master of Thieves for the Platinum Yendorian Express Card. And so on.

Quest artifacts are powerful. Most provide magic resistance, which
you absolutely need. Some provide other useful properties like
telepathy or warning. Getting your quest artifact is a milestone
that marks the transition from "surviving" to "preparing for the
endgame."

If your alignment record is too low (from attacking peacefuls, for
instance), your quest leader will refuse to send you. Keep your
hands clean.

#### Fort Ludios

Fort Ludios is optional and easy to miss entirely. It appears as a
magic portal somewhere in the dungeon, often behind a wall that
requires digging to reach. The portal leads to a fortified military
compound filled with soldiers, lieutenants, captains, and a whole
lot of gold.

The fort is guarded heavily. Soldiers come in numbers, and they
carry useful items: C-rations, K-rations, and sometimes decent
weapons. The real prize is the gold (thousands of pieces) and the
occasional chest. This is a good place to visit if you need money
for protection rackets or shop purchases, but it's not essential
for victory.

If you can't find the portal, don't worry about it. Fort Ludios is
a bonus, not a requirement.

#### Medusa's Island

Medusa's level sits near the bottom of the Dungeons of Doom, around
level 25. You'll know it by the large body of water and the
statues scattered around (those used to be adventurers).

The level has three challenges stacked together:

1. **Crossing the water.** The island is surrounded by water.
   You'll need levitation, water walking boots, or some creative
   approach (freezing water with a wand of cold, building a boulder
   bridge, polymorphing into a flying creature). Don't wade in
   without preparation, because:

2. **Giant eels.** The water is home to giant eels that can grab
   and drown you if you're burdened. Stay unburdened while crossing,
   or avoid the water entirely.

3. **Medusa herself.** Her gaze turns you to stone. You need
   either **reflection** (a shield of reflection or amulet of
   reflection bounces the gaze back, stoning her instead) or
   **blindness** (you can't meet her gaze if you can't see). A
   mirror also works if you apply it at her. Reflection is the
   cleanest solution. If you got the amulet of reflection from
   Sokoban, you're already prepared.

There is a downward staircase (or ladder) on the island itself
that leads toward the Castle. The level has four possible layouts
(two added in version 3.6.0), so don't rely on memorizing a
single map.

> **Arien Malec's Medusa Checklist**
>
> *Arien Malec collected crossing strategies from dozens of RGRN
> posters back in the early 2000s. His original guide, with input
> from Pat Rankin, Geoduck, Topi Linkala, and others, remains one
> of the most consulted single-topic spoilers ever written. Here
> is a condensed version.*

**Surviving Medusa's gaze.** You need one of the following before
entering her level:

- **Reflection** (amulet, shield, or silver dragon scale mail).
  Her gaze bounces back and stones her instead. This is the
  cleanest solution and the one most players use.
- **Blindfold or towel.** Wear it before entering line of sight.
  You'll need telepathy or monster detection to navigate while
  blind. Works perfectly but makes the level harder to explore.
- **A mirror.** Apply it at Medusa to reflect her gaze at close
  range. More dangerous than passive reflection since you need to
  be adjacent.
- **One-shot kill.** If you have a wand of death, the spell finger
  of death, or a cockatrice corpse, you can kill Medusa before she
  gets a turn. Combine with speed or stealth for reliability.

**Crossing the water.** The island is surrounded by deep water.
Your options, from safest to most desperate:

- **Levitation** (ring, boots, potion, or spell). Cleanest method.
  You float over the water without touching it, immune to eel
  grabs from below.
- **Water walking boots.** You walk on the surface. Eels can still
  grab you, so stay unburdened.
- **Wand of cold.** Zap the water to freeze a path of ice. Ice
  is safe to walk on. This is reliable and only costs a few
  charges.
- **Scroll of earth.** Creates boulders that fall into the water,
  making a boulder bridge. Slow but works if you have nothing else.
- **Polymorph** into a flying or swimming creature. Risky if you
  lack polymorph control.
- **Jumping boots or the knight's jump.** Can leap across narrow
  water gaps, but requires careful positioning.

**Surviving the eels.** The water contains giant eels (and
sometimes a kraken) that can grab and drown you. Critical rules:

- Stay **unburdened** while near or in water. A burdened character
  grabbed by an eel is almost certainly dead.
- An **oilskin cloak** or **greased armor** makes you harder to
  grab. Greasing wears off, so it's not fully reliable.
- **Magical breathing** (amulet or polymorph) means you survive
  being pulled under, buying time to escape.
- **Kill eels at range** whenever possible. Wands, spells, and
  thrown weapons all work. Don't melee eels in the water.
- Levitation and water walking do NOT protect against being grabbed
  and pulled under. Only magical breathing, staying unburdened, and
  killing eels first are reliable defenses.

#### The Castle

The Castle is the last level of the Dungeons of Doom proper, around
level 27. It's a large fortified structure surrounded by a moat,
with a drawbridge as the main entrance. A maze section to the
side contains a minotaur.

To enter the Castle, you need to open the drawbridge. Options:

- **Play the passtune.** A five-note musical sequence played on a
  tonal instrument (a tooled horn, bugle, or magic harp) opens
  the drawbridge. The notes are randomized per game. You can learn
  them by trying different sequences: the game tells you how many
  notes are correct after each attempt, like a game of Mastermind.
- **Wand of opening** pointed at the drawbridge.
- **Spell of knock** cast at the drawbridge.
- **Wand of striking** on the portcullis.

Inside the Castle, you'll find a throne room, barracks, and several
treasure chambers. One of those chambers contains a **wand of
wishing**, typically with three charges. This is one of the most
important items in the game. Use your wishes wisely (see
[Wishes and Wishing](#wishes-and-wishing)).

Below the Castle lies Gehennom. There is no going back to the
upper dungeon once you descend without climbing back up through
everything. Make sure you're prepared before you go down.

#### The Oracle

Somewhere in the mid-levels of the Dungeons of Doom (around levels
5 through 9), you'll find a special room containing the Oracle of
Delphi, flanked by centaur statues and a fountain.

The Oracle offers two services:

- **Minor consultations** are cheap and produce fortune-cookie-style
  messages, occasionally useful but mostly atmospheric.
- **Major consultations** are expensive but provide genuinely
  helpful gameplay information: hints about monsters, items, and
  game mechanics.

The Oracle is peaceful and never attacks. Her room is a safe place
to rest for a moment, though the fountain is subject to the usual
fountain risks.

### Traps and Hazards

You never see them coming. That's the whole point.

Traps are invisible until you step on one, detect it with a search
(`s` command), or reveal it by other means. Once discovered, they
show up as `^` on your map—small consolation after you've already
fallen in a pit. Each search of an adjacent square has an independent
chance of revealing a trap, but the chance is well under 100%, so
search repeatedly in suspicious areas. Your pet, being closer to the
ground and warier by nature, will hesitate to step on traps it
knows about—watch its movement for clues.

Here are the traps you'll encounter, roughly grouped by how much
you'll regret finding them:

#### Nuisance Traps

| Trap            | Effect                                              |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Arrow trap      | Fires an arrow at you (modest damage)               |
| Dart trap       | Fires a dart, may be poisoned                       |
| Squeaky board   | Makes noise, wakes nearby monsters                  |
| Rust trap       | Splashes water, rusting exposed metal equipment     |
| Rolling boulder | A boulder rolls at you (dodge or take heavy damage) |

Annoying but rarely lethal. The silver lining: arrow and dart traps
produce free ammunition. Veterans sometimes trigger them deliberately
to stock up.

#### Movement Traps

| Trap             | Effect                                                     |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pit              | You fall in, take minor damage, can climb out              |
| Spiked pit       | Like a pit, but with spikes (more damage, possible poison) |
| Trapdoor         | Drops you to the next level down                           |
| Teleport trap    | Teleports you randomly on the level                        |
| Level teleporter | Teleports you to a random dungeon level                    |
| Hole             | Like a trapdoor, but you can see it                        |
| Magic portal     | Transports to a different branch (branch entrances)        |

Trapdoors and level teleporters are the most disruptive—one wrong
step and you're separated from your pet, your stash, and your
carefully explored map. But with teleport control (from an item or
intrinsic), teleport traps become free transportation. Levitation
makes you immune to pits and holes entirely, floating serenely
above them.

#### Dangerous Traps

| Trap              | Effect                                               |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Land mine         | Explosion, heavy damage, items can be destroyed      |
| Bear trap         | Holds you in place until you escape                  |
| Sleeping gas trap | Puts you to sleep (helpless for several turns)       |
| Fire trap         | Burns you, destroys scrolls and potions in inventory |
| Magic trap        | Random magical effects (some good, some very bad)    |
| Anti-magic field  | Drains your magical energy to zero                   |
| Polymorph trap    | Polymorphs you into a random creature                |

Fire traps are the sleeper threat. The fire itself hurts, but
the real catastrophe is your inventory: scrolls burn, potions
shatter, and that stack of twenty scrolls of identify you've been
hoarding is suddenly ash. Fire resistance saves your skin but
*not* your belongings.

Polymorph traps are a double-edged sword. With polymorph control,
they're a free polymorphing booth. Without it, you become something
random—possibly a newt that can't use any of its equipment.

Sleeping gas is murder in monster-rich areas. You can't fight, you
can't run, you can't even wake up on purpose. Monsters line up
to hit you like it's a buffet.

#### Searching and Detection

The best defense against traps is finding them before they find you:

- **Search (`s`)** repeatedly—each search has an independent chance
  to reveal each adjacent trap, and Luck improves the odds
- **Wand of secret door detection** reveals traps in its path
- **Crystal ball** can reveal traps across the entire level
- **Pets** avoid known traps, so watch their pathfinding for clues
- **Flying and levitation** make you immune to most floor traps

Below dungeon level 5, a quick search before stepping into a new
corridor segment is cheap insurance. The turn you spend searching
is always cheaper than the turns you spend climbing out of a
spiked pit.

#### Finding Secret Doors

The Dungeons of Doom were designed by architects who believed that
every room should have one emergency exit that requires ten minutes
of tapping on walls to locate. Secret doors and corridors are the
game's passive-aggressive way of saying "you haven't explored
*thoroughly* enough."

**When to search for secrets:**

- **Dead ends** that feel too convenient. If a corridor just stops,
  and you haven't found what you came for, there's probably a door
  in the surrounding walls
- **Suspiciously empty rooms** with no obvious exit. The exit exists;
  it's just been cunningly disguised as a wall
- **After exhausting all visible options.** When you've explored
  everything reachable and still haven't found the downstairs, it's
  time to stop wandering and start wall-tapping

**The systematic approach:**

Type `20s` to search twenty times in one spot. For new characters
with average Luck, you need 15-22 searches to reliably reveal a
secret. Searching once and moving on is essentially announcing your
intention to remain lost.

Move three squares along the wall and repeat. This creates overlapping
search coverage—any secret door in that wall segment gets searched
from multiple adjacent positions, which dramatically improves your
odds. The pattern looks tedious on paper because it *is* tedious,
but tedium is cheaper than being trapped on Dlvl 1 forever.

**Items that help:**

- **Ring of searching** auto-searches every turn you move
- **Excalibur** (if wielded) improves search chances
- **Lenses** (any kind, if worn) boost secret detection
- **Wand of secret door detection** instantly reveals nearby secrets
- **Blessed scroll of magic mapping** shows every secret door on the level

**The wisdom of patience:**

Secret doors are NetHack's way of teaching you that brute force
doesn't solve every problem—sometimes you need brute force applied
methodically to every wall section in sequence. The downstairs you
seek is behind one of these walls. Finding it is a matter of
systematic elimination. The only mistake is giving up after three
searches and declaring the level "impossible."

#### Elbereth

> *The mechanics below are drawn from Kate Nepveu's Elbereth FAQ
> (2001, updated 2002), one of the clearest single-topic guides in
> the NetHack community. Kate also maintained steelypips.org, the
> long-running archive that preserved decades of community spoilers.*

Elbereth is not a trap, but it belongs in a chapter about dungeon
hazards because it is your best defense against many of them.

Writing the word "Elbereth" on the ground (using the engrave
command, `E`) creates a protective ward. Most monsters will not
attack you in melee while you stand on an Elbereth square. This
applies whether you wrote it or found it already engraved.

Elbereth has rules:

- **It only works while you stand on it.** Step off and the
  protection ends.
- **Attacking a monster erases it.** If you fight in melee while
  standing on Elbereth, the word smudges and you lose protection.
  In version 3.6.1 and later, this also costs you −5 alignment as
  punishment for defiling the sacred word with violence. Elbereth
  is defensive only — use it to buy time, not to fight from.
- **Some monsters ignore it.** Anything represented by `@` (humans,
  elves, player-like creatures), the Riders on the Astral Plane,
  Angels, minotaurs, unique/named monsters (quest nemeses, Vlad,
  etc.), and blind monsters all disregard Elbereth.
  Shopkeepers and guards also ignore it. Cornered monsters with
  no retreat path will fight through Elbereth rather than stand
  still. In general, any creature intelligent enough to be
  "human-like," any creature that is blind, and anything that has
  nowhere to flee will walk right through.
- **It must be the only text on the square.** If there's already
  an engraving, you need to overwrite it. Adding Elbereth to an
  existing message won't work.
- **Engraving is an interruptible occupation.** In current
  editions, writing with anything other than a wand takes multiple
  turns (one per letter). If you're interrupted mid-word — by an
  attack, a teleport trap, or anything else — you get a partial
  engraving that does nothing. This makes wands (which write the
  whole word instantly) far more valuable for emergency Elbereth.
- **Durability varies by method.** In current editions, the
  engraving is not gradually eroded by scaring monsters. Instead,
  it persists until you take a hostile action (which destroys it
  instantly) or, for dust engravings, until monsters walk over it.

| Method            | Speed    | Durability    | Notes                           |
| ----------------- | -------- | ------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Finger (dust)     | Instant  | Fragile       | Smudges when monsters step on it |
| Athame            | Several turns | Semi-permanent | Interruptible; doesn't dull    |
| Edged weapon      | Several turns | Semi-permanent | Interruptible; dulls weapon by −1 |
| Hard gem/diamond  | Several turns | Semi-permanent | Interruptible                 |
| Wand of digging   | Instant  | Semi-permanent | Good middle ground              |
| Wand of fire      | Instant  | Permanent     | Best method; burns into floor   |
| Wand of lightning | Instant  | Permanent     | Same as fire                    |

Burning with a wand of fire or lightning is ideal: it takes only
one turn, produces a permanent engraving, and cannot be interrupted.
A wand of digging is the next best option, also instant. Writing
in dust with your finger is free and instant but erases almost
immediately. All other methods take multiple turns and leave you
vulnerable — use them only when you have breathing room.

**Impairment and errors.** If you are blind, confused, stunned, or
hallucinating, you have a chance of misspelling Elbereth with each
letter. A misspelled Elbereth has no power. This makes engraving
under duress unreliable unless you use an instant method (wand of
fire burns the whole word at once, regardless of impairment).

**Levitation and durability.** If you are levitating, dust
engravings beneath you won't be erased by monster movement, because
you're floating above the square. This makes dust-Elbereth more
durable than usual.

The practical use: when things go badly and you need a moment to
recover (quaff a healing potion, read a scroll, use an escape
item), write Elbereth in the dust and stand on it. Most monsters
will back off, giving you a turn to act. For a more permanent safe
spot, burn it with a wand of fire. Permanent Elbereth squares
are useful for stashing items, resting, or creating safe retreat
points in dangerous areas. It works in most of the dungeon, and
it costs nothing but a wand charge.

## Part Three: The Locals

### A Field Guide to Dungeon Fauna

The Mazes are home to hundreds of monster species, organized into
classes denoted by letters. Lowercase letters are generally smaller
or less dangerous; uppercase letters are larger or more threatening.
Color further distinguishes individual species within a class.

Here is a quick field guide to what each letter means, roughly ordered
by how early you might encounter them:

#### Common Early Encounters

| Symbol | Class     | Notes                                                                                   |

### Dangerous Encounters

> *The catalog of instadeaths below is informed by Trevor Powell's
> Instadeath Spoiler, compiled from RGRN posts and Dylan O'Donnell's
> spoiler files around 2001. Trevor defined an instadeath as "a
> single move death which does not involve the player's hit points
> dropping to zero," and his taxonomy has been the standard reference
> ever since.*

Some things in the Mazes kill you outright. Not by whittling down
your hit points, not by wearing you down over time, but by ending
your life in a single move with no second chance. These are called
instadeaths, and learning to recognize the situations that produce
them is the difference between a promising run and a one-line
epitaph.

#### Petrification (Stoning)

Anything involving cockatrices or Medusa. Touching a cockatrice
without gloves, eating a cockatrice corpse, being hit by Medusa's
gaze, or even stepping on a cockatrice corpse while barefoot will
turn you to stone. The process can be immediate or delayed (you'll
see the message "You are slowing down" with a few turns to act).

**Defenses:** Wear gloves when handling cockatrice corpses. Carry
a lizard corpse at all times (eating it cures stoning in progress).
Use reflection against Medusa. Stoning resistance (from eating an
acid blob or certain other sources) makes you immune.

**The other side of the coin:** a wielded cockatrice corpse (with
gloves on) is one of the most devastating weapons in the game.
Anything you hit with it that lacks stoning resistance turns to
stone.

#### Drowning

Giant eels and krakens can grab you and pull you underwater. If
you're burdened or worse when grabbed, you can drown before you
get a turn to respond. This happens most often at Medusa's level
and in the endgame.

**Defenses:** Stay unburdened near water. An amulet of magical
breathing lets you survive underwater. Levitation keeps you above
the water entirely. Kill sea monsters at range whenever possible.

#### The Touch of Death

Some monsters, most notably Death (one of the Riders on the Astral
Plane), can kill you with a single touch. The Finger of Death spell
and the wand of death work similarly.

In current editions, the touch of death has been reworked. It now
deals heavy damage (8d6 + 50) and permanently drains your maximum
HP by half the damage dealt, rather than being a simple binary
kill. You only die outright if the drain would reduce your max HP
to zero. This means a high-level character with many hit points
can survive a touch that would have been instantly fatal in older
editions.

**Defenses:** Magic resistance blocks the instadeath component of
the touch of death and the wand/spell, but in current editions you
still take damage and max HP drain even with magic resistance.
Death himself (the Rider) is a special case and ignores magic
resistance entirely. An amulet of life saving will revive you once.

#### Starvation

This isn't technically instant, but it feels like it. If your
nutrition drops to zero, you faint. If you don't eat something while
fainted, you die. In the early game before you've established a food
supply, starvation is a real threat.

**Defenses:** Eat corpses promptly. Pray when your god is willing
and you are Weak or Fainting (prayer cures hunger). Carry food
rations, tripe rations, or lembas wafers. Don't let nutrition
management slide.

#### Brainlessness

Mind flayers drain Intelligence with their tentacle attacks. If
your Intelligence reaches zero, you die instantly. In current
editions, mind flayers no longer cause amnesia, but the Intelligence
drain is still lethal if unchecked.

**Defenses:** Wear a greased helmet to prevent tentacle attacks
from connecting. Kill mind flayers at range (wands, spells). Use a
unicorn horn or other means to restore lost Intelligence before it
reaches critical levels.

#### Choking

If you eat while already satiated, you can choke and die. The game
warns you ("You're having a hard time getting all of it down"), but
if you confirm, you're dead.

**Defense:** Don't eat when satiated. Just don't.

#### Deadly Poison

A handful of monsters (pit vipers, some spiders) have instantly
lethal poison attacks. The chance is low but nonzero. Eating
certain corpses (Death, Pestilence) is also instantly fatal poison.

**Defenses:** Poison resistance makes you immune. Most characters
can get this early by eating enough appropriate corpses. It's one
of the first intrinsics worth acquiring.

#### Disintegration

A black dragon's breath weapon disintegrates you. Touching a
wide-angle disintegration beam also kills. In current editions,
black dragons also have a passive disintegration attack — hitting
one in melee can disintegrate the attacker.

**Defenses:** Disintegration resistance (from eating a black dragon
corpse or wearing black dragon scale mail). Reflection bounces the
beam back. Magic resistance does NOT protect against disintegration.

#### Genocide

Reading a scroll of genocide while confused can genocide your own
race. Don't do this.

#### The Amulet of Life Saving

This deserves special mention. An amulet of life saving, when worn,
revives you once from any death (including instadeaths). The amulet
is consumed in the process. If you find one, save it for the
endgame or for situations where instadeath risk is high. It's your
insurance policy.

#### Delayed Deaths

Not every fatal threat kills instantly. Several give you a few
turns to react. Knowing the warning signs and the cures can save
a run.

**Stoning (slow).** If a cockatrice hits you (or you handle one
without gloves), you may begin turning to stone over several turns.
The messages progress: "You are slowing down," then "Your limbs are
stiffening," then death. **Cures:** eat a lizard corpse (this is
why you carry one at all times), eat an acidic corpse, pray if your
god is willing, cast stone to flesh on yourself, or use a wand of
polymorph or amulet of unchanging to interrupt the process.

**Sliming.** Being hit by a green slime starts a transformation
that ends in you becoming a green slime (dead). The process takes
several turns with messages about your body changing. **Cures:**
burn the slime off with fire (a wand of fire zapped at yourself,
a scroll of fire, walking into a fire trap, a red dragon's breath),
pray, or change form via polymorph. Fire is the most reliable cure.

**Illness (food poisoning).** Eating a rotten corpse or being
struck by certain attacks (Pestilence, for example) gives you food
poisoning, which kills in a fixed number of turns. You'll see
"You feel deathly sick." **Cures:** a unicorn horn (apply it), pray,
eat a eucalyptus leaf, or vomit (by being satiated and eating
more). Vomiting from other causes also cures illness. Poison
resistance does NOT protect against food poisoning (it only
protects against strength-draining and instant-kill poison).

**Sinking in lava.** Falling into lava without levitation or fire
resistance gives you a few turns to escape before you sink and die.
Your inventory is also at risk. **Cures:** prayer, levitation
(put on levitation boots or a ring), teleport, or just step out if
you can. Fire resistance prevents the damage but doesn't prevent
sinking. Lava immersion also destroys most of your inventory.

**Drowning (being held).** When grabbed by an eel or kraken while
in water, you have a few turns to escape before drowning. If
you're burdened, you may not get even one turn. **Cures:** magical
breathing (amulet or spell), kill or teleport the eel before it
pulls you under, stay unburdened near water, or avoid the water
entirely.

**Strangulation.** Wearing a cursed amulet of strangulation slowly
kills you over a few turns. **Cure:** remove the amulet (requires
uncursing it first, since cursed amulets can't be removed — use a
scroll of remove curse, holy water, or prayer).

#### The Essential Kit

The short version: the big three are **magic resistance**, **reflection**,
**poison resistance**, and a **lizard corpse** to survive the
dungeon's worst surprises. Get these as early as you can. Everything
else is luxury. These are survival.

### Making Friends

The Mazes of Menace are dark, hostile, and full of things that want
to eat you. Under those circumstances, a loyal companion is worth
more than a bag of gold. Fortunately, the dungeon provides.

#### Starting Pets

Most roles begin with a faithful pet—a little dog or a kitten,
depending on your role. This small creature is more useful than it
looks. It follows you between levels (if adjacent when you take
stairs), fights alongside you, picks up items, and eats food it
finds on the floor. Think of it as a self-propelled, self-feeding
trap detector with teeth.

A pet that eats well and fights often will grow. A little dog
becomes a dog, then a large dog. A kitten becomes a housecat, then
a large cat. A grown large dog or large cat is a genuine combat
asset, capable of taking on mid-dungeon threats that would give
you trouble.

One more thing: your pet will not step on cursed items willingly.
This makes it one of the cheapest identification tools in the
game—drop items on the ground and watch whether your pet avoids
them. If it refuses to walk over a square, something cursed is
sitting there.

#### Feeding and Loyalty

Pets have an invisible tameness score that decreases over time and
when they take damage. When tameness hits zero, your loyal friend
goes feral and turns on you. Feeding is the antidote:

- **Dogs and cats** love tripe rations and most meat
- **Horses** prefer apples, carrots, and other vegetarian fare

Tripe rations are ideal for dogs and cats. You'll find them
scattered through the dungeon—always pick them up, even though
they're revolting food for humans. Your pet will adore you for it.

#### Taming New Creatures

If your starting pet perishes (or you want an army), several
methods of taming exist:

- **Throwing food** at a suitable creature: meat for dogs and cats,
  produce for horses
- **Scroll of taming** tames all creatures within a radius
- **Spell of charm monster** tames a single adjacent creature
- **Magic trap effects** occasionally produce taming

The beautiful thing is that taming isn't limited to small animals.
With a scroll of taming or the charm monster spell, you can recruit
almost anything: a purple worm to swallow your enemies whole, a
dragon to breathe fire at them, a titan to crush them underfoot.
Only unique monsters (Medusa, the Wizard) and a few special
creatures resist your charms entirely.

#### What Pets Do for You

A well-fed pet earns its keep in several ways:

- **Combat muscle.** A strong pet clears rooms and softens up
  dangerous monsters before you engage
- **Curse detection.** The old drop-and-watch trick, described
  above—free, reliable, and available from turn one
- **Shoplifting.** If your pet picks up an item inside a shop and
  carries it out the door, the shopkeeper blames the animal, not
  you. This takes patience (the pet must wander onto the item,
  then wander back out) but it's the cheapest way to acquire a
  wand of wishing from a shop
- **Sacrifice fodder.** Monsters your pet kills leave corpses
  you can sacrifice on altars, exactly as if you'd killed them
  yourself

#### Keeping Your Pet Alive

Pets die from the same things you do: traps, poison, powerful
monsters, drowning in water. Keep an eye on your companion's
health (`;` to farlook) and don't lead it into fights it can't
win. A dead pet is not just a loss of utility—it's a cold feeling
in the pit of your stomach.

If you change levels and your pet isn't adjacent, it won't follow.
The game tells you: *"You have a sad feeling for a moment."* Your
pet is still alive on the previous level, but its loyalty is
ticking down. Go back for it before it forgets you were friends.

### The Identification Problem

Here is the central puzzle of the Mazes, and the thing that kills
more promising expeditions than any monster: you will find dozens of
items, and you won't know what most of them are.

That potion might heal you or it might make you hallucinate. That
scroll could enchant your armor or destroy it. That ring could grant
you invisibility or slowly starve you to death. In the Mazes,
ignorance is not bliss. Ignorance is death by unidentified wand.

Every game, the dungeon shuffles the deck. Potions, scrolls, wands,
rings, amulets, and spellbooks are all given randomized appearances.
The "milky potion" in this game might be healing; in your next game
it might be paralysis. The only things that stay consistent between
games are the item classes themselves (a `!` is always a potion, a
`?` is always a scroll) and the prices, which turn out to be the
single most powerful identification tool you have.

#### Blessed, Uncursed, Cursed

Before you can worry about *what* an item is, you need to know
*what condition* it's in. Every item in the Mazes is blessed, uncursed,
or cursed — BUC for short — and the difference matters far more than
you'd think. The gods have opinions about your equipment, and those
opinions have consequences:

- A **blessed** scroll of identify generously reveals every item in
  your pack. A cursed one grudgingly identifies a single item, as
  if doing you a favor.
- A **cursed** piece of armor bonds to your skin like it has
  abandonment issues. You cannot remove it until you lift the curse.
- A **cursed** potion of gain level interprets "gain a level" in the
  most literal architectural sense — you rocket through the ceiling
  to the floor above, instead of gaining an experience level.

The pattern is consistent: blessed items are helpful beyond their
description, uncursed items work as advertised, and cursed items find
creative ways to ruin your day. A blessed luckstone passively
improves your luck; a cursed one drags it down. A cursed scroll of
teleportation sends you somewhere terrible. You get the idea.

You don't see BUC status by default (Priests are the exception — they
sense it naturally, which tells you something about clerical
paranoia). But there are several reliable ways to check:

**Altar testing.** Drop an item on an altar:

  - An amber flash means blessed.
  - A black flash means cursed.
  - No flash means uncursed.

This is free, fast, and unlimited. If you find an altar early,
use it heavily.

**Pet testing.** Your pet won't step on cursed items. If you drop
something and your dog walks around it, it's cursed. If the dog walks
over it (or picks it up), it's safe. Not as precise as an altar, but
works anywhere.

**Holy water.** Dipping an item in blessed water (holy water) will
uncurse or bless it. Dipping in cursed water (unholy water) will curse
it. Holy water is precious in the early game, so save it for items
you've already identified.

**Scroll of identify.** A blessed scroll of identify will identify
everything in your pack at once. This is the gold standard, but you
need to identify the scroll first (irony noted) and bless it.

#### The Price Is Right

Shopkeepers are, without exaggeration, your most important
identification tool. Every unidentified item has a fixed base price
that depends on what it actually is. When you pick up an item in a
shop, the shopkeeper quotes you a price derived from that base price,
modified by your Charisma and the shopkeeper's markup.

The key insight: items in the same category that share a base price
are in the same **price group**. If you know the price, you can
narrow down the possibilities enormously, sometimes to just two or
three candidates.

Here's how to do it. Pick up an item in a shop and note the price
quoted. The quote will be higher than base price (shopkeepers mark
up). With average Charisma, the sell price is typically one third of
base and the buy price is roughly double. You don't need to memorize
exact formulas. What matters is grouping: items quoted at similar
prices are in the same price tier.

The price tables for each item class follow. These are your
field reference for shopping trips.

##### Scroll Prices

| Base Price | Scrolls                                                                                                           |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $20        | identify                                                                                                          |
| $50        | light                                                                                                             |
| $60        | blank paper, enchant weapon                                                                                       |
| $80        | enchant armor, remove curse                                                                                       |
| $100       | confuse monster, destroy armor, fire, food detection, gold detection, magic mapping, scare monster, teleportation |
| $200       | amnesia, create monster, earth, taming                                                                            |
| $300       | charging, genocide, punishment, stinking cloud                                                                    |

The $100 group is crowded, which makes scroll price-ID less precise
than other categories. But you can still narrow things down. If a
scroll is in the $20 group, it's identify. Period. That's one of the
most useful scrolls in the game and you just found it for free.

##### Potion Prices

| Base Price | Potions                                                                            |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $50        | booze, fruit juice, see invisible, sickness                                        |

| $150       | blindness, gain energy, invisibility, monster detection, object detection          |
| $200       | enlightenment, full healing, levitation, polymorph, speed                          |
| $250       | acid, oil                                                                          |
| $300       | gain ability, gain level, paralysis                                                |

Water is always the "clear" potion, so if you see "clear potion" you
know what it is without even checking the price. The $50 group is
tricky because sickness and see invisible are in there together (one
very good, one very bad). The $200 group is packed with excellent
potions.

##### Ring Prices

| Base Price | Rings                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $100       | adornment, hunger, protection, protection from shape changers, stealth, sustain ability, warning                                                                           |
| $150       | aggravate monster, cold resistance, gain constitution, gain strength, increase accuracy, increase damage, invisibility, poison resistance, see invisible, shock resistance |
| $200       | fire resistance, free action, levitation, regeneration, searching, slow digestion, teleportation                                                                           |
| $300       | conflict, polymorph, polymorph control, teleport control                                                                                                                   |

The $300 group is extremely informative: only four rings live there,
and three of them (conflict, polymorph control, teleport control) are
among the most powerful in the game.

##### Wand Prices

| Base Price | Wands                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $100       | light, nothing                                                                                                                                                 |
| $150       | digging, enlightenment, locking, magic missile, make invisible, opening, probing, secret door detection, slow monster, speed monster, striking, undead turning |
| $175       | cold, fire, lightning, sleep                                                                                                                                   |
| $200       | cancellation, create monster, polymorph, teleportation                                                                                                         |
| $500       | death, wishing                                                                                                                                                 |

If a wand costs $500, you are having a very good day.

##### Amulet Prices

All amulets have a base price of $150 except the cheap Amulet of
Yendor imitations ($0). Price doesn't help here. You'll need to rely
on other methods.

#### The Engrave Test (Wands)

This is the single most useful trick for wand identification and
costs you nothing. Apply a wand by engraving on the floor with it
(command: `E`, then select the wand). What happens tells you what
the wand is:

| What you see when you engrave           | Wand type                       |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| "A lit field surrounds you"             | light                           |
| Your engraving vanishes                 | cancellation / make invisible   |
| "Bugs appear in the engraving"          | create monster                  |
| You feel self-knowledgeable             | enlightenment                   |
| "The engraving in the floor is gone"    | polymorph / teleportation       |
| Your engraving is smudged               | secret door detection           |
| The floor is riddled by holes           | digging                         |
| The bugs on the floor stop moving       | sleep                           |
| Lightning strikes the engraving         | lightning                       |
| The engraving is covered in frost       | cold                            |
| The engraving catches fire              | fire                            |
| Nothing happens (charge is used)        | nothing                         |
| You write in the dust                   | all BEAM wands                  |

The engrave test costs one charge per wand but preserves the rest.
With one zap you can sort most wands into clear categories. For BEAM
wands (which just write in the dust like a finger), you'll need
further testing: try zapping them at a monster or in a safe direction.

**Warning:** In current editions, cursed wands may **explode** when
used to engrave. BUC-test your wands before engraving with them.

Crucially, engraving with a wand of wishing does nothing special.
It just uses a charge. So if you suspect you have a wand of wishing
($500 price), do NOT engrave with it. Zap it directly.

#### The Sink Test (Rings)

If you find a sink (usually in a kitchen), you can drop a ring down
it. Each ring type produces a characteristic message:

| Message you hear or see                  | Ring type                      |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| "The water flow seems fixed"             | sustain ability                |
| "The water flow seems stronger/weaker"   | gain constitution / gain strength |
| "The sink quivers upward"                | levitation                     |
| "You smell rotten &lt;fruit&gt;"         | poison resistance              |
| "Several flies buzz angrily"             | protection from shape changers |
| "Static electricity surrounds the sink"  | shock resistance               |
| "The water flow seems lesser/greater"    | increase damage / increase accuracy |
| "The cold water faucet flashes brightly" | fire resistance                |
| "The hot water faucet flashes brightly"  | cold resistance                |
| "The sink seems to blend into the floor" | stealth                        |
| "You don't see anything happen"          | invisibility                   |
| "You thought your ring got lost..."      | searching                      |
| "You hear a loud grinding sound"         | aggravate monster               |
| "The sink glows silver"                  | free action                    |
| "The water flow hits the bottom"         | hunger                         |
| "You see the ring slide right down"      | slow digestion (never lost)    |
| "The sink looks as good as new"          | regeneration                   |
| "You see a ring shining in its center"   | adornment                      |
| "The faucets flash from the water"       | warning                        |
| "The sink momentarily vanishes"          | teleportation                  |
| "The sink looks nothing like a deck"     | polymorph                      |
| "The sink starts running like crazy"     | conflict                       |
| "You hear a strange wind"               | teleport control               |
| "The sink seemingly makes no change"     | polymorph control              |
| "The ring is regurgitated"               | protection                     |

You have about a 95% chance of losing the ring each time, so only
test rings you're willing to sacrifice. The two exceptions: searching
and slow digestion rings are never lost.

#### Use-Testing (The Careful Way)

When you don't have access to a shop or a sink, you can sometimes
figure out what an item is by using it carefully. Here's the approach
for each category:

**Potions.** The safest test is to throw a potion at a monster and
observe the effect. Throwing avoids the risk of drinking something
lethal. If a potion heals the monster, it's some kind of healing
potion. If the monster speeds up, it's speed. If the monster becomes
invisible, well, you've learned something (and now have an invisible
monster to deal with).

You can also dip items into potions. Dipping a weapon into a potion
of sickness will poison it, confirming the potion's identity. Dipping
a unicorn horn into a potion of confusion, hallucination, or sickness
will turn it into water.

**Scrolls.** Reading is risky. Some scrolls (destroy armor, amnesia,
punishment) are genuinely harmful. The safest approach is to price-ID
first, then read scrolls from safe price groups. If you must test
blind: take off your armor before reading a scroll that might be
destroy armor. Read from a position where teleportation won't be
disastrous.

Confused reading produces different effects for many scrolls and is
sometimes useful. A confused scroll of remove curse, for example,
will *curse* items instead.

**Rings.** First, confirm the ring is not cursed (altar or pet test).
Then put it on. Many rings produce an immediate message or visible
effect: you start levitating, you become invisible, you feel
stronger. If nothing obvious happens, check your stats and inventory
for subtle changes (protection, searching). Take it off quickly if
you start feeling hungry faster than normal (hunger ring) or if
monsters seem to be approaching more aggressively (aggravate monster).

**Amulets.** Most amulets are safe to wear briefly. Put it on, wait
a few turns, take it off. The dangerous ones (strangulation, restful
sleep) are usually cursed, so check BUC first. An amulet of ESP
reveals itself if you go blind while wearing it (you'll see monsters
as brain-shapes). Amulet of reflection is trickier to detect, but
you'll notice it when a ray bounces off you.

**Armor.** Try it on (after checking it's not cursed). Magical armor
reveals itself immediately: speed boots make you faster, a cloak of
invisibility makes you invisible. Mundane armor is identifiable by
its appearance (the "old gloves" are leather gloves, "riding boots"
are fumble boots, and so on).

Here's a useful table of boot and helmet appearances:

| Appearance       | Possible identity                      |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| mud boots        | elven boots (stealth)                  |
| buckled boots    | kicking boots                          |
| riding boots     | fumble boots (often cursed!)           |
| snow boots       | levitation boots (often cursed!)       |
| hiking boots     | jumping boots                          |
| combat boots     | speed boots                            |
| jungle boots     | water walking boots                    |
| conical hat      | dunce cap OR cornuthaum                |
| crystal helmet   | helm of brilliance (fixed appearance)  |
| plumed, etched, crested, or visored helmet | one of: regular helmet, helm of caution, helm of opposite alignment, helm of telepathy (randomized each game) |

#### Gray Stones: Four Stones, One Correct Answer

Gray stones deserve their own section because they look identical
but have wildly different value. There are four types:

| Stone      | Base Price | Effect                                     |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Flint      | $1         | Ammunition. Useless to carry around.       |
| Luckstone  | $60        | Preserves luck. Essential.                 |
| Touchstone | $45        | Identifies gems when rubbed. Very useful.  |
| Loadstone  | $1         | Weighs 500 units. Usually cursed. Confers steadfastness. A trap. |

The problem: all four look like "a gray stone" until identified.
Here's how to tell them apart:

**The kick test.** Kick an unidentified gray stone on the floor.
If it scoots away normally, it's not a loadstone. A loadstone is
abnormally heavy and resists being kicked.

**The pick-up test.** A cursed loadstone cannot be dropped once
picked up — it magically returns to your inventory. If you pick up
a gray stone and it weighs you down suspiciously, try to drop it.
If you can't, it's a cursed loadstone. Uncurse it immediately
(holy water, scroll of remove curse, prayer) so you can get rid
of it.

**The price test.** If you can reach a shop: a $60 gray stone is a
luckstone. A $45 gray stone is a touchstone. A $1 gray stone is
flint or a loadstone.

**The rub test.** Apply (`a`) a gray stone. If it's a touchstone,
rubbing a valuable gem against it will produce a "streak" message
identifying the gem. If nothing happens, it's not a touchstone.

**Location clue.** The luckstone at Mine's End is guaranteed. If
you find a gray stone at the bottom of the Mines, it's almost
certainly the luckstone. Bless-test it at an altar to confirm
(the guaranteed one is always uncursed).

The rule of thumb: if you find a gray stone, don't pick it up
until you've tested it. A loadstone can ruin your encumbrance, and
if it's cursed, you're stuck with it until you find a way to
uncurse. Kick it first. Check BUC second. Then pick it up.

#### Naming What You've Learned

As you gather clues, use the `#name` command (or `N`) to track what
you know. You can **call** an entire item class by a name you choose.
For example, if you've determined that "fizzy potions" are in the $200
price group, call them "fizzy=$200" so you don't forget. If you later
throw one at a monster and it speeds up, you can rename the class to
"speed."

This habit of annotating your discoveries is what separates adventurers
who die on level 8 from adventurers who reach the Castle. The dungeon
doesn't keep notes for you. You have to do it yourself.

#### A Practical Strategy

All of these techniques combine into a workflow. Here's what a
seasoned traveler does on a typical descent:

**At an altar** (priority one). Ferry everything you've found to the
altar. Drop each item. Sort your pack into blessed, uncursed, and
cursed piles. Wield or wear the blessed stuff. Stash or discard the
cursed stuff.

**At a shop** (priority two). Pick up and put down unidentified items
to get price quotes. Group them by price. Cross-reference with the
tables above. Suddenly half your inventory is narrowed to two or three
possibilities.

**Engrave-test your wands** as soon as you find them. It's fast, it
costs only one charge, and it immediately sorts wands into categories.
A wand that digs the floor is digging. A wand that freezes your
engraving is cold. Simple.

**Experiment cautiously** with the rest. Wear non-cursed rings one at
a time. Throw potions at monsters. Read scrolls from safe price groups
after removing your armor.

**Save your scrolls of identify** for the items that resist other
methods: amulets (all the same price), spellbooks (dangerous to
read if unknown), and the one stubborn potion in the $50 group that
you can't quite pin down.

```
  The Identification Flowchart:

     Found an item
          │
          ▼
     Can you reach an altar? ──yes──► Drop it. Check BUC.
          │ no
          ▼
     Is your pet nearby? ──yes──► Drop it. Does pet avoid it?
          │ no                        │ yes: it's cursed
          ▼                           │ no: it's safe (uncursed/blessed)
     Can you reach a shop? ──yes──► Check the price. Consult tables.
          │ no
          ▼
     Is it a wand? ──yes──► Engrave-test it.
          │ no
          ▼
     Is it a ring + sink nearby? ──yes──► Drop it in the sink.
          │ no
          ▼
     Is it safe to use-test? ──yes──► Try it carefully.
          │ no
          ▼
     Save a scroll of identify for it.
```

The whole system is about reducing uncertainty with the cheapest,
safest method first. Altars and shops are free. Engrave-testing costs
one charge. Use-testing costs more and carries risk. Scrolls of
identify are the expensive last resort. Work through the list in order
and you'll rarely be surprised.

### Provisions and Dining

Of all the things that kill adventurers in the Mazes of Menace —
the dragons, the liches, the cockatrices, the inexplicable decision
to kick a sink — none is quite as embarrassing as starving to death
while carrying forty thousand gold pieces. Hunger is the dungeon's
most persistent clock: every turn you spend costs nutrition, and
when the tank hits empty, you faint. Faint a few times without
eating and you die. It is, in the grand tradition of roguelikes,
completely your fault.

#### How Hunger Works

Your nutrition starts at 900 and ticks down steadily. The rate
depends on what you're doing:

- **Base consumption** costs 1 point per turn (less while sleeping).
- **Regeneration** (from a ring or intrinsic) costs extra on odd turns.
- **Encumbrance** costs extra on odd turns if you're burdened or worse.
- **Rings** cause additional hunger while worn. Two rings drain faster.

When nutrition drops below certain thresholds, you get warnings:

| Nutrition | Status    | Effect                                    |
| --------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 1000+     | Satiated  | Overfull. Eating more risks choking.      |
| 150-999   | Normal    | Fine.                                     |
| 50-149    | Hungry    | Warning message. Time to eat.             |
| 0-49      | Weak      | Movement slowed. Pray if possible.        |
| Below 0   | Fainting  | Collapse randomly. Eat NOW or die.        |

The practical takeaway: eat when you get the "Hungry" message. Don't
wait for "Weak." If you hit Fainting and have no food, pray to your
god (see [Divine Relations](#divine-relations)). Prayer cures hunger
if your god is willing to help.

#### What to Eat

**Food rations** provide 800 nutrition and are the staple food. They
weigh 20 and are common in shops. Stockpile these when you can.

**Lembas wafers** are better: 800 nutrition at only 5 weight, the
best ratio in the game. Elven characters find these more often.

**Corpses** are the primary food source in the early game. Most
fresh corpses provide nutrition proportional to the monster's size.
A few rules:

- Eat corpses within a few turns of the kill, or they rot and cause
  food poisoning (lethal without treatment).
- Never eat old corpses. If in doubt, don't eat it.
- Some corpses grant intrinsic resistances (poison resistance from
  killer bees, fire resistance from fire giants, etc.). Eat these
  deliberately.
- Some corpses are harmful (floating eyes paralyze you, green slimes
  turn you into slime, cockatrice corpses kill you). Know which
  corpses are safe before eating.

**Tripe rations** are terrible for you (your character retches) but
pets love them. Save tripe for your pet.

**Tins** are preserved food that never spoil. They take several
turns to open (one turn with a tin opener, three with a dagger,
more with bare hands). Blessed tins open instantly. A tin of
spinach increases your strength.

#### Dangerous Foods

**Cockatrice corpse:** instant death by stoning. Never eat this.

**Acidic corpses** (acid blob, etc.): damage unless acid resistant.

**Poisonous corpses:** damage and stat drain unless poison resistant.

**Rotten corpses:** food poisoning. Pray immediately if affected.

**Cannibalism** (eating your own race): costs 2 to 5 luck and
gives the aggravate monster intrinsic. Cavemen and orcs are exempt.

#### Useful Corpse Effects

| Corpse               | Effect                             |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Floating eye         | Telepathy (but paralyzes you too)  |
| Killer bee           | Poison resistance                  |
| Fire giant/ant       | Fire resistance                    |
| Winter wolf          | Cold resistance                    |
| Wraith               | Gain an experience level           |
| Giant                | Increase strength                  |
| Lizard               | Cures stoning in progress          |
| Newt                 | May restore 1 to 3 mana            |
| Stalker              | Invisibility (and see invisible)   |
| Tengu                | Teleportitis / teleport control    |
| Disenchanter         | Intrinsic protection               |

Eating for intrinsics is one of the most important things you can
do in the early and mid game. Poison resistance should be a top
priority.

#### Food Strategy

1. Eat fresh corpses as your primary food source.
2. Save food rations and lembas wafers for emergencies.
3. Eat intrinsic-granting corpses deliberately (even if not hungry).
4. Pray when Weak or Fainting if you have nothing to eat.
5. Buy food from shops when you can afford it.
6. Don't carry more food than you need. It's heavy.

### The Apothecary

The dungeon is full of mysterious bottles. Ruby liquids, milky
fluids, smoky concoctions—each one a small gamble between salvation
and catastrophe. The colors are shuffled every game, so the "bubbly
potion" that healed you last time might polymorph you this time.
Identification is everything.

#### The Potion Table

As with all randomized items, price is your best friend. A shop
visit narrows a mysterious bottle from "could be anything" to a
short list of candidates:

| Price | Potions at this price                                                              |

Water is the oddity in the $100 group—it always appears as "clear
potion," identifiable on sight. Don't underestimate it; water is
the raw material for holy water, which is the foundation of
everything.

#### Key Potions

**Healing, extra healing, full healing.** The healing chain, and
your lifeline in combat. Extra healing is the workhorse: it cures
blindness and sickness in addition to restoring HP. Blessed extra
healing and full healing also raise your maximum HP permanently.
You can never have too many of these.

**Gain ability.** When blessed, raises *all* your stats by 1.
Uncursed raises a random stat. This is liquid gold: save every
one until you can bless it.

**Speed.** One blessed quaff and you're permanently faster for the
rest of the game. Speed is arguably the single most important buff
in NetHack; the difference between moving at normal speed and fast
speed is the difference between trading blows and hitting twice
before they swing once. In current editions, the wand of speed
monster no longer grants permanent speed when self-zapped—only a
temporary burst of 50–74 turns. The potion is the real prize.

**Holy water.** Not a potion you find—a potion you *make*. Drop
uncursed water on a co-aligned altar, pray, and the gods bless it
for you. Holy water can then bless any item you dip into it. This
is the engine that drives your entire inventory: blessed scrolls
of identify, blessed potions of gain ability, blessed scrolls of
enchant weapon. You will never have enough holy water.

**Gain level.** Raises your experience level by 1. Useful for
reaching quest eligibility quickly, or converting into something
better through alchemy.

#### Alchemy

Here's where potions get interesting. Dip one potion into another
and you might create something better—or you might cause an
explosion. Most combinations are duds, but the useful recipes are
worth memorizing:

| Dip this            | Into this           | Result         |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | -------------- |
| Healing             | Gain energy/level   | Extra healing  |
| Extra healing       | Gain energy/level   | Full healing   |
| Full healing        | Gain energy/level   | Gain ability   |
| Fruit juice         | Gain energy/level   | See invisible  |
| Speed               | Healing             | Extra healing  |
| Speed               | Extra healing       | Levitation     |

The chain from healing → extra healing → full healing → gain ability
via gain energy or gain level is the core alchemy sequence, and it's
extraordinarily powerful. A handful of common healing potions and a
gain energy or two can be transmuted into the rarest potions in the
game. Treat every gain energy potion like the catalyst it is.

Fair warning: there's a 10% chance of explosion on any non-water
mixture, so do your chemistry in a safe place and away from your
stash. Cursed potions used as the dipping target always explode.

#### Unicorn Horn Interactions

A unicorn horn dipped into certain potions purifies them:

- **Blindness, confusion, hallucination** → uncursed water
- **Sickness** → fruit juice

This turns dangerous potions into useful raw materials. The water
can be blessed into holy water; the fruit juice can be alchemized
into see invisible. Nothing is wasted in a well-run dungeon
pharmacy.

### The Scroll Rack

Scrolls are the dungeon's single-use spells: read once, triggered,
gone. They appear with absurd randomized labels—"ZELGO MER,"
"DAIYEN FOOELS," "PRATYAVAYAH"—that stay consistent within a game
but mean nothing until you identify them. The labels are part of
the charm. You'll develop superstitious favorites.

#### The Scroll Table

Price-identification is especially powerful for scrolls, because the
cheapest scroll ($20) is always identify—the one you need most:

| Price | Scrolls at this price                                                                                             |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $20   | Identify                                                                                                          |
| $50   | Light                                                                                                             |
| $60   | Blank paper, enchant weapon                                                                                       |
| $80   | Enchant armor, remove curse                                                                                       |
| $100  | Confuse monster, destroy armor, fire, food detection, gold detection, magic mapping, scare monster, teleportation |
| $200  | Amnesia, create monster, earth, taming                                                                            |
| $300  | Charging, genocide, punishment, stinking cloud                                                                    |

The $60 group is treasure (enchant weapon lurks there alongside
innocent blank paper). The $80 group is equally good: enchant armor
and remove curse, two scrolls you'll always want more of. The $100
group is the danger zone—a grab-bag mixing magic mapping and
teleportation with destroy armor. And at $300, you'll find both
genocide (one of the strongest effects in the game) and punishment
(a ball and chain permanently attached to your ankle). Choose wisely.

#### Key Scrolls

**Identify.** The bread and butter of dungeon life. Blessed identify
reveals multiple items at once (with positive luck, always at least
two). You will never have enough of these.

**Enchant weapon / enchant armor.** The path to endgame power.
Each scroll raises enchantment by +1 (uncursed) or potentially
more (blessed). Important: enchanting beyond +5 risks
destroying the item entirely, but blessed scrolls can safely push
to +7. Save these for your ascension kit, bless them, then savor
every +1.

**Remove curse.** Frees you from cursed equipment. Uncursed version
works on worn and wielded items only; blessed version uncurses your
entire inventory. Every adventurer has a "put on a cursed ring"
story. This scroll is the happy ending.

**Charging.** Recharges wands and rechargeable tools. Save these
for your wand of wishing—one charge means one more wish. Blessed
charging restores more charges. But don't get greedy: each recharge
increases the chance the wand explodes. The second recharge is
pushing your luck; the third is usually fatal for the wand.

**Genocide.** The nuclear option. Uncursed eliminates a single
species; blessed wipes an entire monster class from the game
forever. Liches and mind flayers are popular targets. Read one
while confused and you genocide your own race—which kills you
instantly. Read carefully.

**Magic mapping.** Reveals the entire level layout; blessed also
shows secret doors. Invaluable in Gehennom's maddening mazes,
where mapping by hand could take a lifetime you don't have.

**Scare monster.** The trick: don't read it. Drop it on the floor
and stand on it. It works like a permanent Elbereth, frightening
most monsters away. The catch: pick it up after it's been dropped
and it crumbles to dust. So choose your standing spot wisely.

**Teleportation.** Uncursed teleports you randomly on the level.
Cursed or confused reading sends you to a random dungeon level.
With teleport control, *you* choose where you land—making this
one of the most versatile escape tools in the game.

#### Confused Reading

Here's a trick the dungeon doesn't advertise: many scrolls do
something completely different when read while confused. Some of
these alternate effects are *better* than the normal ones:

- **Confused destroy armor** doesn't destroy anything—it
  *erodeproofs* a piece of armor. One of the best tricks in the game
- **Confused enchant armor / enchant weapon** also erodeproof
  instead of enchanting. Useful when you need protection from rust
  more than another +1
- **Confused remove curse** has a 25% chance of blessing *or*
  cursing each uncursed item—risky, but it's a clever way to create
  holy water if you confuse-read while carrying uncursed potions of
  water
- **Confused genocide** genocides your own role. This kills you.
  Don't get confused at the wrong moment

### Wands and Staves

Wands are reusable magical items that produce directed effects when
zapped. They come in three types: **ray wands** fire a beam in a
direction that bounces off walls, **beam wands** affect what they
hit in a straight line, and **non-directional wands** affect the
area around you.

#### The Wand Table

| Price | Wand                    | Type  | Max Charges |
| ----- | ----------------------- | ----- | ----------- |
| $100  | Light                   | NODIR | 15          |
| $100  | Nothing                 | BEAM  | 15          |
| $150  | Digging                 | RAY   | 8           |
| $150  | Enlightenment           | NODIR | 15          |

| $175  | Fire                    | RAY   | 8           |

| $175  | Sleep                   | RAY   | 8           |
| $200  | Cancellation            | BEAM  | 8           |

| $200  | Teleportation           | BEAM  | 8           |
| $500  | Death                   | RAY   | 8           |
| $500  | Wishing                 | NODIR | 3           |

#### Key Wands

**Wishing.** The most valuable item in the game. Each zap grants one
wish. In current editions, wands of wishing generate with only **1
charge** and can be recharged once (and only once) to a maximum of
1 additional charge. This means the Castle wand of wishing typically
yields 2 wishes plus a possible wrested third — a significant
reduction from older versions where it could provide 5 to 7. Plan
your wishes carefully before you find one.

**Death.** Fires a death ray that instantly kills most things it
hits. Reflected by reflection. Blocked by magic resistance. One
of the best offensive tools in the late game.

**Digging.** Essential utility. Dig through walls to create
shortcuts, dig down to escape dangerous situations, dig through
rock to reach vaults and hidden areas. Every ascension kit should
include a wand of digging.

**Teleportation.** Zap monsters to send them somewhere else on the
level. Zap yourself to teleport. Enormously useful for escaping
trouble or removing a dangerous monster from your path.

**Fire, cold, lightning.** Offensive ray wands that bounce off walls.
Fire burns scrolls and spellbooks on the floor. Cold freezes water
(useful for creating paths). Lightning blinds monsters.

**Cancellation.** Removes special properties from items and monsters.
A cancelled monster loses most of its special attacks. Do NOT put
this wand in a bag of holding (it will explode the bag). Keep it
separate in your main inventory.

**Polymorph.** Transforms monsters into random other monsters and
items into random other items of the same class. Can be used
creatively (polymorph a pile of junk armor hoping for dragon scale
mail, polymorph a weak monster hoping for a useful corpse). Risky
but powerful.

#### Identification by Engraving

The engrave test (described in
[The Identification Problem](#the-identification-problem)) is the
fastest way to sort wands. Every wand type produces a distinctive
result when used to engrave on the floor.

> *Kieron Dunbar's "Identifying Wands by Zapping" spoiler,
> originally posted to RGRN, describes a systematic protocol for
> narrowing down wand identity through controlled experiments. The
> approach below is adapted from his checklist.*

#### Beyond Engraving: Systematic Wand Testing

The engrave test sorts most wands immediately, but a few produce
ambiguous results. For those, a systematic testing protocol helps:

**Step 1: Note the wand category.** When you engrave, the result
tells you whether the wand is NODIR (non-directional), RAY, or
BEAM (immediate). This alone cuts the possibilities dramatically.

- **NODIR wands** (light, nothing, enlightenment, create monster,
  secret door detection, wishing): Most reveal themselves through
  the engrave test messages. Light creates a lit field. Enlightenment
  makes you feel self-knowledgeable. Create monster says "bugs
  appear." If nothing visible happens but a charge was used, it's
  the wand of nothing.
- **RAY wands** (digging, magic missile, fire, cold, lightning,
  sleep, death): Digging riddles the floor with holes. Fire, cold,
  and lightning produce obvious elemental effects. Sleep stops bugs
  from moving. Magic missile and death just write in dust. Of these
  two, death is $500 — check the price first.
- **BEAM wands** (everything else): The engrave test doesn't
  distinguish most beam wands well. If the engraving vanishes, it's
  cancellation or make invisible. If the engraving disappears
  entirely, it's teleportation or polymorph. For the rest, further
  testing is needed.

**Step 2: Safe zapping tests.** For wands that remain unidentified
after engraving, zap them at safe targets:

- **Zap at a locked chest or door.** A wand of opening unlocks it.
  A wand of locking locks it. A wand of striking breaks it.
- **Zap at a corpse on the floor.** A wand of undead turning raises
  it as a zombie. A wand of polymorph transforms it.
- **Zap at a tame or weak monster.** Speed monster makes it faster.
  Slow monster makes it slower. Make invisible makes it vanish.
  Probing reveals its stats.
- **Zap at a cancellable item** (a potion, a figurine). Cancellation
  will dull it. Note: cancellation does NOT affect booze, fruit
  juice, or oil, so don't use those as test subjects.

**Step 3: When in doubt, check the price.** If testing hasn't
resolved the wand, its shop price narrows the field further. A
$150 wand is one of twelve types. A $200 wand is one of four.
A $500 wand is death or wishing — and you should be very careful
with it either way.

#### Recharging

Wands can be recharged with a scroll of charging. Each recharge
increases the risk of the wand exploding. The formula is
(recharges cubed) / 343, so:

- First recharge: 0.3% explosion chance.
- Second: 2.3%.
- Third: 7.9%.
- Seventh: 100%.

Wands of wishing can only be recharged once before they explode
automatically. Use blessed charging for the best results.

#### Wresting

When a wand has 0 charges, you can still try to zap it. There is a
1/121 chance of "wresting" one final charge from the wand before it
turns to dust. This is a last resort, but it works on wands of
wishing too.

### Rings and Amulets

Two ring fingers. One neck. These are the most constrained equipment
slots in the game, which makes choosing what to wear a genuine
strategic decision. Both rings and amulets have randomized
appearances, and some of the best items in the game hide behind
unassuming descriptions like "granite ring" or "circular amulet."

#### The Ring Table

| Price | Ring                           | Notes                          |
| ----- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| $100  | Adornment                      | +CHA, chargeable               |
| $100  | Hunger                         | Increases hunger (auto-curse)  |

| $200  | Fire resistance                | Resist fire attacks            |
| $200  | Free action                    | Immune to paralysis            |
| $200  | Levitation                     | Float in the air               |
| $200  | Regeneration                   | Heal faster (costs hunger)     |
| $200  | Searching                      | Auto-search each turn          |
| $200  | Slow digestion                 | Reduces hunger                 |
| $200  | Teleportation                  | Random teleports (auto-curse)  |
| $300  | Conflict                       | Monsters fight each other      |
| $300  | Polymorph                      | Random polymorphs (auto-curse) |
| $300  | Polymorph control              | Choose polymorph form          |
| $300  | Teleport control               | Choose teleport destination    |

Rings marked "auto-curse" generate cursed 90% of the time. If you
slip on a ring and can't remove it, you've just learned what
auto-curse means the hard way.

**The rings that matter most:** Free action is arguably the single
best ring in the game—paralysis is death in the late game, and
this ring makes you immune. Teleport control turns random
teleportation from a nuisance into on-demand transportation.
Conflict makes monsters attack each other instead of you, which
is devastating on crowded levels (though it also turns your pets
hostile). Slow digestion lets you go indefinitely between meals.

**The hidden cost:** Every ring you wear increases your hunger rate.
Two rings drain food noticeably faster. The veteran habit is to
keep rings in inventory and slip them on only when needed—free
action before fighting mind flayers, conflict before entering a
throne room. Economy of fingers is an art.

#### Amulets

Amulets are simpler in theory but harder to identify—they all cost
$150, so price is no help. You'll need to wear-test or use a scroll
of identify. The stakes are high, because the range runs from "saves
your life" to "slowly strangles you to death":

| Amulet                 | Effect                                      |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Life saving            | Revives you once from death, then crumbles  |
| Reflection             | Reflects ray attacks                        |
| Magical breathing      | Survive underwater and without air          |
| ESP                    | Detect monsters via telepathy               |
| Unchanging             | Prevents involuntary polymorph              |
| Versus poison          | Poison resistance                           |
| Flying                 | Grants flight (new in current editions)     |
| Guarding               | +2 AC and +2 MC (new in current editions)   |
| Strangulation          | Slowly kills you (always cursed)            |
| Restful sleep          | Puts you to sleep randomly (usually cursed) |

**Life saving** is the crown jewel. When you die—any kind of
death—it triggers, revives you at full HP, and crumbles to dust.
Wear it whenever you're going somewhere dangerous. Take it off when
you're safe. You only get the one miracle.

**Reflection** is excellent if you didn't get a shield of reflection
from Perseus's statue or elsewhere. Wearing it as an amulet frees
up your shield slot for a small shield or two-weapon fighting.

**Guarding** provides +2 AC and +2 magic cancellation (MC). This
is a new addition in current editions that neatly solves the MC
puzzle: pair it with a cloak of magic resistance (MC1) and you
reach MC3, freeing you from needing the less versatile cloak of
protection.

**Magical breathing** prevents drowning—which sounds niche until
you reach Medusa's level (surrounded by water) or the Plane of
Water (entirely underwater). Then it's existential.

#### Identification

Rings and amulets resist casual identification. The best approaches:
drop rings down sinks (each type produces a unique message),
wear-test in safe areas (risky with auto-cursing types), or use
scrolls of identify. For amulets, there's no price trick—identify
scrolls or careful wear-testing are your main options. Always
BUC-test an amulet before putting it on; cursed amulets of
strangulation are one of the most embarrassing ways to die.

### Tools of the Trade

The `(` symbol covers the dungeon's most eclectic category: pickaxes,
magic lamps, unicorn horns, musical instruments, crystal balls, and
bags that eat other bags. If it doesn't fit neatly into any other
class, it's a tool. Some of the most powerful items in the game hide
in this grab-bag.

#### Containers

| Container      | Weight | Special                                  |
| -------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Sack           | 15     | Basic storage                            |
| Oilskin sack   | 15     | Protects contents from water             |
| Bag of holding | 15     | Reduces weight of contents dramatically  |
| Bag of tricks  | 15     | Creates monsters when opened (not a bag) |
| Large box      | 350    | Holds 0 to 3 items, often locked         |
| Chest          | 600    | Holds 0 to 5 items, often locked         |
| Ice box        | 900    | Preserves corpses from rotting           |

The **bag of holding** deserves its own paragraph because it
transforms how you play. A blessed bag reduces the weight of
everything inside to roughly one quarter—meaning you can carry your
entire potion supply, your backup armor, your scroll library, and
still have room for loot. Get one from Sokoban or wish for one
early. It's that important.

The cardinal rule: **never** put a wand of cancellation, another bag
of holding, or a charged bag of tricks inside a bag of holding. The
resulting magical explosion scatters your carefully curated
inventory across the floor. In older editions it *destroyed*
everything. Either way, it's a game-ending mistake that every
veteran has made exactly once.

#### Unlocking Tools

The dungeon is full of locked things, and brute force is noisy and
slow. A **skeleton key** is the gold standard (70%+ success on
doors, 75%+ on boxes). A **lock pick** is respectable. A **credit
card** is the worst but still better than kicking. Always carry one
of these—the weight is negligible and the utility is constant.

#### Light Sources

**Oil lamps** and **candles** light dark corridors, which is
pleasant but not essential. The real prize is the **magic lamp**:
rub it while blessed and there's an 80% chance a djinni emerges
and grants you a wish. Never, ever use a magic lamp for light.
That's like using a winning lottery ticket as a bookmark.

The **Candelabrum of Invocation** is a unique candelabra found in
Vlad's Tower. It's one of three items needed for the invocation
ritual to enter Moloch's Sanctum. You'll need seven candles to
fill it—so start hoarding candles when you find them.

#### Musical Instruments

Music has power in the Mazes. A **tooled horn** or **bugle** is
needed to play the passtune at the Castle drawbridge (you'll find
the notes nearby—listen carefully). A **magic harp** charms monsters
into tameness. A **magic flute** puts them to sleep. A **drum of
earthquake** creates pits around you, which is as chaotic as it
sounds.

Non-magical instruments (wooden flute, leather drum) produce noise
but no special effects—useful only for confusing the issue.

#### Other Notable Tools

| Tool               | Use                                           |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| Pickaxe / mattock  | Dig through walls and floors                  |
| Unicorn horn       | Cure poison, confusion, blindness, nausea     |
| Stethoscope        | Check HP and status of a monster              |
| Tin opener         | Open tins in one turn                         |
| Tinning kit        | Preserve corpses as tins                      |
| Blindfold          | Voluntarily go blind (useful for telepathy)   |
| Towel              | Wipe cream pie from face, use as blindfold    |
| Magic marker       | Write scrolls and spellbooks on blank paper   |
| Crystal ball       | Detect objects, traps, and portals on a level |
| Bell of Opening    | Invocation item (found in Vlad's Tower area)  |
| Leash              | Tie a pet to you so it follows through stairs |

The **unicorn horn** is arguably the single most important tool in
the game. Apply it to cure confusion, blindness, sickness,
hallucination, and nausea—basically every status ailment that
matters. Carry one at all times. If you don't have one, getting
one should be near the top of your priority list.

The **magic marker** is a printing press for scrolls. Write scrolls
of identify, enchant weapon, enchant armor, or anything else on
blank paper or blank scrolls. Charges are limited and precious:
writing a scroll you've already identified costs fewer charges, so
identify first, write second. A well-used magic marker can produce
half your ascension kit.

### The Armory

Weapons and armor are the bread and butter of combat. Your choice
of equipment determines how hard you hit, how well you dodge, and
what special resistances you carry.

#### Armor and AC

Armor Class (AC) starts at 10 and decreases as you add protection.
Lower is better. Each point of AC reduces the chance of being hit.
At AC -10 or below, you're quite difficult to damage with physical
attacks.

The key armor slots:

| Slot   | Best mundane options                       | Best magical options                  |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Body   | Splint mail, banded mail                   | Dragon scale mail (two resistances!)  |
| Cloak  | Cloak of protection                        | Cloak of magic resistance             |
| Helmet | Helm of brilliance                         | Helm of telepathy                     |
| Gloves | Gauntlets of power                         | Gauntlets of dexterity                |
| Boots  | Speed boots                                | Water walking boots, levitation boots |
| Shield | Shield of reflection                       | Small shield (for spellcasters)       |

**Dragon scale mail** is the endgame body armor of choice. In
current editions, each color provides two extrinsic resistances.
Gray dragon scale mail provides magic resistance and is the most
popular wish target. Silver provides reflection. Black provides
disintegration resistance and drain resistance (the only
non-artifact source). Green provides poison resistance and
sickness immunity.

To get dragon scale mail: kill a dragon, pick up the scales it
drops, then either read a blessed scroll of enchant armor while
wearing the scales (they transform into scale mail), or wish for
the mail directly.

**Speed boots** are one of the most powerful items in the game.
Being faster than your enemies means you get more turns, which
means more chances to attack, cast spells, or run away.

**Cloak of magic resistance** provides magic resistance in the cloak
slot and frees up other slots for different resistances. However,
be aware that since 3.6.0, **magic cancellation (MC) values were
overhauled**: the cloak of magic resistance now provides only MC1,
not MC3. The **cloak of protection** is now the only single item
that provides MC3, which blocks 90% of monster special attacks (down
from 98% in older editions). A ring of protection now contributes
+1 MC, and the new amulet of guarding provides +2 MC, giving you
more ways to assemble full magic cancellation coverage.

#### Weapons

Weapon choice depends heavily on your role and skill caps.

| Weapon         | Damage (sm/lg) | Notes                              |
| -------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Long sword     | d8 / d12       | Lawfuls can dip for Excalibur      |
| Katana         | d10 / d12      | Best base damage for a one-hander  |
| Silver saber   | d8 / d8        | +d20 vs silver-hating monsters     |
| Crysknife      | d10 / d10      | Excellent damage, fragile          |
| Tsurugi        | d16 / d8+2d6   | Two-handed, bisects small monsters |
| Runesword      | d4 / d6+d4     | Chaotic weapon                     |
| Battle-axe     | d8+d4 / d6+2d4 | Two-handed, good damage            |
| Rubber hose    | d4 / d3        | No, seriously, don't use this      |

**Excalibur** (long sword dipped in a fountain while Lawful) is one
of the best weapons: +d5 to hit and damage, level drain resistance,
automatic searching. For Lawful characters, getting Excalibur early
is a priority.

**Silver saber** deserves special mention. Many endgame threats
(demons, undead, werecreatures) are vulnerable to silver. A silver
saber does an extra d20 damage against them, making it one of the
best late-game weapons.

**Your quest artifact** is often your primary weapon or at least
worth carrying for its properties. Check what your role's artifact
does.

#### Enchantment

Weapons and armor can be enchanted using scrolls of enchant weapon
and enchant armor. Each scroll adds +1 (uncursed) or potentially
more (blessed). Enchanting beyond +5 risks destroying the item,
though blessed scrolls reduce this risk. The absolute safe limit
for enchanting is +5 for weapons and +3 for armor (with uncursed
scrolls). Blessed scrolls can push higher safely.

#### Erosion and Proofing

Weapons and armor can be damaged by rust (iron items), fire
(organic items), and corrosion (copper items). A badly damaged
item provides less AC or damage.

To fix erosion, read a confused scroll of enchant weapon (for your
weapon) or confused scroll of enchant armor (for a random worn armor
piece). This erodeproofs the item permanently without changing its
enchantment. It also repairs any existing damage.

---

### Artifacts

Scattered throughout the Mazes are items of legend — named weapons,
amulets, and tools that carry powers no ordinary gear can match. Each
artifact exists only once per game, so when you find one, you're
holding a genuine one-of-a-kind. Here's how they come into your
hands:

- **Fountain dipping** (Excalibur, for Lawful characters).
- **Sacrifice** on an altar (your god may gift you an aligned artifact).
- **Quest completion** (each role's unique quest artifact).
- **Wishing** (you can wish for most artifacts, but they resist
  if they don't match your alignment).
- **Random generation** (rare, but weapons have a small chance of
  being generated as an artifact).

#### Alignment and Blasting

Each artifact has an alignment. If you try to handle an artifact
that doesn't match your alignment:

- **Intelligent artifacts** (most quest artifacts): 8d6 damage and
  you drop the item. You cannot wield these.
- **Other misaligned artifacts**: 4d4 damage on first touch, 1/4
  chance of being blasted each subsequent touch.

#### Key Artifacts

**Excalibur** (Lawful, long sword): +d5 to hit and damage, level
drain resistance, automatic searching. The go-to weapon for Lawful
characters.

**Grayswandir** (Lawful, silver saber): +d5 to hit and damage,
double damage dealt, halved physical damage received. One of the
best weapons in the game. Wishable.

**Mjollnir** (Neutral, war hammer): Can be thrown and returns like
a boomerang (if STR 25). +d5 to hit and +d24 damage against non-
shock-resistant targets. Requires high strength to use effectively.

**Magicbane** (Neutral, athame): +d3 to hit and damage, protects
against curses while carried, cancels monsters on hit. Useful as
a secondary weapon. Can be obtained by sacrifice.

**Stormbringer** (Chaotic, runesword): +d5 to hit and damage,
drains one level from hit targets (you gain it). Attacks peaceful
monsters automatically, which can cause alignment problems.

**The Eyes of the Overworld** (Neutral, lenses): Magic resistance,
astral vision. A quest artifact for Monks.

**Quest artifacts** vary wildly by role but most provide magic
resistance, which makes them important to carry even if you don't
wield them. Check your specific role's artifact.

## Part Five: The Craft of Adventuring

> *Part Five draws on Matthew Lahut's RGRN prayer guide, Steven
> Bush's spellbook reading tables, and the Hugo/O'Donnell files on
> gods, combat, gems, and luck mechanics, all updated for the
> current edition.*

---

### Divine Relations

Your relationship with your god is one of the most important
mechanics in the game. A happy god answers prayers, forgives
transgressions, and occasionally sends gift artifacts. An angry god
smites you.

#### Prayer

> *Matthew Lahut's Praying Spoiler, originally posted to RGRN and
> archived on steelypips.org, remains the definitive reference for
> the prayer system. The mechanics below draw from his work.*

Praying (`#pray`) calls on your god for help. When conditions are
right, prayer is the single most powerful emergency tool in the
game. When conditions are wrong, it can kill you.

**What prayer fixes (in priority order).** Your god addresses your
problems in a specific order, fixing the most urgent first:

1. Petrification in progress (stoning)
2. Sliming in progress
3. Strangulation
4. Sinking in lava
5. Illness (food poisoning, sickness)
6. Severe hunger (Weak or Fainting)
7. Critically low HP (less than 5, or less than 1/7 of max)
8. Lycanthropy
9. Blindness, confusion, stunning, hallucination
10. Punishment (iron ball and chain)

After resolving your problems, your god may grant additional
blessings: fixing minor afflictions, improving your alignment,
or even gifting intrinsics like telepathy or speed.

**The requirements for a safe prayer.** All of the following must
be true:

- Your **alignment** must be non-negative. Killing peacefuls,
  robbing shops, and other misdeeds reduce alignment. Sacrifice
  and virtuous behavior raise it.
- Your **luck** must be non-negative. Luck is affected by many
  things (see [Luck and Fortune](#luck-and-fortune)).
- Your god must not be **angry**. God anger is separate from
  alignment and accumulates from specific offenses (breaking
  conduct with your god, desecrating altars).
- The **prayer timeout** must have expired. After a successful
  prayer, you must wait before praying again. The timeout averages
  around 450 turns but can range from under 200 to over 700 due to
  the random formula used. In a genuine emergency (HP critical,
  starving), there is some forgiveness if your timeout is close to
  expiring.
- You must not be **polymorphed** into a demon or undead while
  worshipping a non-chaotic god.
- You must not be in **Gehennom** (unless you worship Moloch, which
  no standard role does). Your god cannot hear you there. This is
  one of the things that makes Gehennom so dangerous.
- If you're on an altar, it should be **co-aligned**. Praying on a
  cross-aligned altar directs your prayer to the wrong god.

**When prayer goes wrong.** If any requirement is unmet, your god
responds with punishment instead of help: loss of alignment, loss of
luck, increased timeout, cursing of worn items, or summoning of
hostile minions. Severe transgressions (praying to a very angry god)
can trigger lightning or disintegration, both potentially fatal.

**Practical guidance.** Pray when you're about to die and have no
other option. Starvation, stoning, illness, and critically low HP
are all valid emergencies. Don't waste prayers on minor
inconveniences. Before you pray, make a mental check: is my
alignment positive? Have enough turns passed? Am I on a co-aligned
altar or no altar at all? If you can't answer yes to these, find
another solution.

**Prayer timeout tracking.** The game doesn't show your timeout
directly, but you can estimate it. Count roughly 500 turns from
your last prayer (more if it went badly). In the early game, when
turns are slow and you're fighting one creature at a time, 500
turns pass quickly. In the late game, when you might take 100
actions per level, it takes longer to feel.

#### Sacrifice

Offering fresh monster corpses at an altar builds favor with your
god. The rules:

- The corpse must be fresh (killed within the last few turns).
- Bigger monsters are more valuable sacrifices.
- The altar must match your alignment, or you're praying to someone
  else's god (which has its own consequences).
- Same-race sacrifice is forbidden and severely punished (with one
  exception: it can convert an altar to your alignment).

With enough sacrifice credit, your god may gift you an artifact
weapon. The first gift comes after relatively modest sacrifice;
subsequent gifts require substantially more. Gift artifacts are
always aligned to your god and always match a weapon skill you can
use.

#### Altars and Alignment

You can convert an altar by sacrificing on a cross-aligned altar
repeatedly. This is risky (the altar's god will be angry) but
useful if the only altar you've found doesn't match your alignment.
Having a co-aligned altar is important for sacrifice, holy water
production, and BUC testing.

#### Crowning

If your alignment record is very high (through sacrifice and good
behavior), your god may crown you. Crowning grants:

- A special title (e.g., "Hand of Elbereth" for lawful characters).
- An artifact weapon appropriate to your alignment, if one is
  available that you can use.
- Intrinsic fire resistance, cold resistance, poison resistance,
  and shock resistance.
- Full healing.

However, crowning also **locks your alignment** (you can never
change it) and raises the prayer timeout to at least 1000 turns.
Many experienced players avoid being crowned because the increased
timeout removes prayer as a reliable emergency tool during the most
dangerous part of the game. If you need to sacrifice a lot to get
an artifact gift, be aware that you might accidentally trigger a
crowning instead. Some players deliberately keep their alignment
record modest until they've secured the items they need.

### The Art of Combat

The most important combat technique in the Mazes is knowing when
*not* to fight. The second most important is making sure you hit
really, really hard when you do.

#### To-Hit Calculation

Every swing of your weapon is a d20 roll, modified by everything
the game can think of to make your life interesting:

- Your experience level (the game's way of saying "you've seen things")
- Your weapon's enchantment (a +7 Excalibur hits *noticeably* better)
- Your Luck (the universe literally takes sides — up to +5 or -5)
- Your Strength bonus (muscles still matter underground)
- The monster's AC (the lower their AC, the harder they are to tag)

You need to roll at or above (10 + defender's AC - your modifiers).
Since some late-game monsters have AC of -10 or worse, this formula
can feel like trying to hit smoke. Enchant your weapon. Keep your
luck up. And maybe don't try to punch an arch-lich.

#### Damage

Base damage depends on your weapon and whether the target is small
or large. (Most weapons are optimized for one or the other, because
apparently dungeon physics care about monster volume.) Added to base:

- Weapon enchantment (+1 per point)
- Strength bonus (up to +6 for STR 18/xx, or more)
- Weapon skill bonus (depends on skill level)
- Special bonuses (silver damage, artifact bonuses, etc.)
- In current editions, **two-handed weapons** get a 50% bonus to
  the strength damage component, which is the Mazes' way of
  rewarding you for giving up your shield

#### AC and Defense

Your AC determines how likely monsters are to hit *you*. The journey
from "I die to gnomes" to "nothing can touch me" looks like this:

| Stage         | Typical AC | Protection level        |
| ------------- | ---------- | ----------------------- |
| Starting out  | 8 to 10    | Wearing a good attitude |
| Early dungeon | 2 to 5     | Basic armor equipped    |
| Mid-game      | -5 to 0    | Enchanted armor + cloak |
| Endgame       | -20 to -10 | Walking tank            |

At AC -20, almost nothing hits you with physical attacks. Feel
free to laugh at ogres. But many late-game threats use special
attacks — breath weapons, spells, gaze attacks — that ignore AC
entirely. You can be wearing impenetrable armor and a disenchanter
will still ruin your day. AC is necessary but not sufficient.

#### Two-Weapon Combat

Some roles can fight with a weapon in each hand, which looks
impressive and gives more attacks per turn. The catch: it splits
your skill bonuses and you can't use a shield. Two-weapon combat
is powerful for roles with high skill caps in it (Rangers,
Barbarians) but a trap for everyone else. If you're not sure, just
use one really good weapon. In current editions, two-handed weapons
got a buff that makes them a compelling alternative to dual-wielding.

#### Fighting Smart

The dungeon rewards cowardice, cunning, and property damage. Here
are the time-tested tactics that keep adventurers breathing:

- **Use corridors.** Monsters can only approach one at a time in a
  corridor. This is the single most important tactical principle in
  the Mazes. Never fight a mob in an open room if you can retreat
  to a chokepoint and fight them in single file. This turns a
  suicide mission into a turkey shoot.
- **Fight at range.** Wands, thrown weapons, and spells let you
  soften up monsters before they reach you. This is especially
  important against monsters with dangerous melee attacks. A fire
  ant is scary in melee. A fire ant that you've already zapped
  three times is just a warm corpse.
- **Know when to run.** The Mazes have no medals for bravery, only
  for survival. If a fight is going badly, use a scroll of
  teleportation, a wand of teleportation, or just run. Dead
  adventurers don't get second chances (unless wearing an amulet
  of life saving).
- **Use conflict.** A ring of conflict makes monsters fight each
  other. Walk into a room full of enemies, put on the ring, and
  watch them destroy each other while you enjoy the show from the
  doorway. Nature is beautiful.
- **Elbereth for emergencies.** Write it, stand on it, recover.
  The monsters will mill around you looking confused and angry,
  which is exactly how you want them.

---

### Wishes and Wishing

There is a moment in every successful game where you're asked,
"For what do you wish?" It's the best question in all of gaming.
Don't panic. Don't mistype. And for the love of all that is holy,
don't wish for a +3 blessed cockatrice. (Actually, that *would*
be something. But no.)

Wishes are rare, powerful, and the difference between a character
who ascends and one who dies memorably on the Plane of Fire.

#### Sources of Wishes

The Mazes are stingy, but there are more wish sources than most
travelers realize:

- **Wand of wishing:** 1 charge, found in the Castle
  treasure room. Rechargeable once for 1 additional charge.
  The Castle chest also contains a potion of gain level, because
  the Mazes occasionally feel generous.
<!-- src/sit.c special_throne_effect(): cases 1-4 (of 13) = wish,
     throne only vanishes on wish, so guaranteed eventual wish. -->
- **Vlad's throne:** A special throne that grants a guaranteed
  wish if you keep sitting. Four of thirteen outcomes are a wish
  (which destroys the throne); the other nine are painful but
  the throne survives, so persistence pays off.
<!-- src/allmain.c: u.uhave.amulet && !u.uevent.amulet_wish -->
- **The Amulet of Yendor:** Grants a wish when you first pick
  it up. A reward for reaching the bottom of the dungeon.
- **Magic lamp:** Rub a blessed lamp for an 80% chance of a wish.
  Either a magic lamp or a magic marker is guaranteed in
  Orcus-town.
- **Fountain:** ~1 in 30 chance of a wish per quaff. Far more
  likely to produce snakes.
- **Throne:** Very rare chance of a wish when sitting. Also a very
  real chance of everything going wrong.
- **Djinni from smoky potion:** Rare (1 in 13 base probability),
  and even then only 20% wish chance (80% if blessed). But when
  it works, you feel like a genius.

Most games give you 4 to 6 wishes total: the Castle wand (2-3
with wresting), Vlad's throne (1), the Amulet pickup (1), and
possibly a magic lamp. That's 4 to 6 chances to shape your
destiny. Don't waste them on food.

#### What to Wish For

Generations of adventurers have argued about optimal wish order.
Here's the conventional wisdom, battle-tested by thousands of
ascensions:

1. **Gray dragon scale mail** (magic resistance + AC — magic resistance
   is the most important protection in the game, so this is highly recommended).
2. **Silver dragon scale mail** (reflection + AC, the second pillar
   of not dying to wands).
3. **Speed boots** (being fast gives you more actions per turn—excellent
   for both offense and escape).
4. **Gauntlets of power** (STR 25, +AC, if your role benefits —
   and most roles benefit from punching harder).
5. **Amulet of life saving** (insurance for the endgame, when
   overconfidence kills more adventurers than monsters do).
6. **A specific artifact** (Grayswandir is a common target for the
   silver damage against everything in Gehennom).

Don't wish for consumables (scrolls, potions) unless you're in
dire straits. Items you can find through normal play aren't worth
a wish. A wish is for things that change the fundamental equation
of your survival.

#### Wish Syntax

When the game asks "For what do you wish?", be specific. This is
not the time for ambiguity:

- "blessed +3 gray dragon scale mail" gets you exactly that.
- Just "gray dragon scale mail" gives you an uncursed +0 version.
  You had *one* wish. Why would you not specify?
- You cannot wish for artifacts that are already generated.
- You cannot wish for the Amulet of Yendor (nice try).

### Spellcasting

Magic in the Mazes is less "wave a wand and sparkles happen" and
more "laboriously study a crumbling book, hope you don't get
paralyzed, and then set things on fire with your mind." Spells are
reusable abilities learned from spellbooks. Unlike scrolls (consumed
on use) or wands (limited charges), spells can be cast repeatedly as
long as you have mana (Pw, power) and the spell hasn't expired from
your increasingly overtaxed brain.

#### Learning Spells

Read a spellbook to learn the spell it contains. Reading takes
several turns and can fail — sometimes catastrophically. A failed
reading can paralyze you, summon hostile monsters, or just waste
your time. Worse, each failed attempt damages the spellbook. Fail
enough times and the book crumbles to dust, taking the spell with
it. It's like the book is *judging* you.

The chance of successfully reading a spellbook depends on three
things: the **spell level**, your **Intelligence**, and your
**experience level**. Higher-level spells demand more of both.
Blessed spellbooks add a bonus (equivalent to a few points of
Intelligence). Cursed spellbooks should never be read — they
always fail and always punish you, because of course they do.

Here's a rough guide to what you can safely read:

| Spell Level | Minimum Int + XL needed | Who can read it reliably     |
| ----------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 1           | ~10                     | Almost anyone, early game    |
| 2           | ~14                     | Most characters by mid-game  |
| 3           | ~18                     | Wizards easily, others with effort |
| 4           | ~22                     | Wizards with decent stats    |
| 5           | ~26                     | Wizards with boosted Int     |
| 6           | ~30                     | Wizards with serious investment |
| 7           | ~34                     | Only well-built Wizards      |

(The "Minimum Int + XL" column means the sum of your Intelligence
and experience level. If you have 18 Intelligence and are level 14,
your sum is 32, and you can reliably read up to level 6 spells. A
blessed book effectively adds 2-3 to this number.)

Wizards are the undisputed masters of magic: they learn faster, fail
less, and have the widest range of useful spells. A well-built Wizard
can eventually learn *every* spell in the game, which is the closest
the Mazes come to letting you cheat. Other roles can cast some spells
but with less panache — a Valkyrie might manage identify (level 3)
but will struggle with anything above level 4. Tourists, Barbarians,
and Cavemen should probably stick to hitting things.

Each spell stays in memory for approximately 20,000 turns, then
fades and must be relearned. You can check how close a spell is
to expiring from your spell list (`+`). Carry important spellbooks
with you if you plan to rely on their spells in the late game —
you can also `a`pply a spellbook to check how many times it's been
read (each reading wears the book down, and they eventually
crumble to dust). Nothing is worse than reaching Gehennom and
discovering your finger of death expired ten levels ago.

In recent editions of the Mazes, the **spell maintenance** system
adds an ongoing cost: known spells gradually drain a small amount
of your maximum power while memorized. Higher-level spells cost
more to maintain. This means you can't just learn every spell you
find — carrying too many memorized spells shrinks your effective
mana pool. Choose wisely and let unneeded spells expire.

#### Key Spells

| Spell           | Level | Effect                                  |
| --------------- | ----- | --------------------------------------- |
| Force bolt      | 1     | Ranged attack (d6 to 4d6 by skill)      |
| Healing         | 1     | Restore hit points                      |
| Identify        | 3     | Identify items (saves scrolls)          |
| Magic mapping   | 5     | Reveal the level (saves scrolls)        |
| Finger of death | 7     | Kill one monster (resisted by MR)       |
| Chain lightning | 7     | Bouncing lightning that hits everything  |
| Charm monster   | 5     | Tame an adjacent creature               |
| Detect monsters | 1     | Sense nearby monsters                   |
| Remove curse    | 3     | Uncurse worn/wielded items              |

For Wizards, learning **identify** and **magic mapping** as spells
dramatically reduces your need for scrolls — it's like having
infinite scrolls, except they cost mana instead of inventory space.
**Finger of death** is the ultimate argument-ender. **Charm
monster** turns your enemies into your friends, which is even better
than killing them because friends carry things and absorb hits.

#### Mana Management

Your power (Pw) pool determines how many spells you can cast before
you need to sit in a corner and regenerate like a phone battery.
Power regenerates over time (faster with higher Wisdom and with a
regeneration source). The Energy Vortex trick: let an energy vortex
hit you while carrying an amulet of reflection, and it will increase
your maximum power. Yes, getting hit by a vortex makes you *more*
magical. The Mazes have their own logic.

High-level spells cost serious power. You can't spam finger of
death unless you have a colossal power pool, and even then you'll
run dry faster than you'd like. Plan your casting, carry backup
options (wands, scrolls) for when your mana runs low, and remember
that a Wizard who can't cast spells is just a person in a bathrobe
holding a stick.

### Curses and How to Break Them

Sooner or later, you will put on something cursed. Maybe it's a
ring you didn't test. Maybe it's boots from a bones level. Maybe
a monster touched your inventory and you didn't notice. However it
happens, you're now wearing an item that refuses to come off, and
it's probably doing something terrible. Welcome to the curse
problem.

#### How Items Get Cursed

- **Born that way.** Some items generate cursed most of the time
  (rings of teleportation, rings of polymorph, amulets of
  strangulation—anything the dungeon thinks is funny)
- **Bones inheritance.** Items on a bones level have an 80% chance
  of being cursed. That tempting armor on the dead adventurer's
  corpse? Probably trapped
- **Monster interference.** Certain monsters can curse items in
  your inventory
- **Confused remove curse.** Reading it confused has a chance of
  *cursing* items instead of uncursing them
- **Unholy water.** The evil twin of holy water

#### Effects of Cursed Items

- **Cursed armor and rings** bond to you and can't be removed—a
  cursed ring of teleportation means random teleports you can't
  stop, and a cursed pair of levitation boots means you can never
  touch the ground again
- **Cursed weapons** can't be unwielded. Hope you like that -3
  orcish dagger
- **Cursed potions and scrolls** often do the opposite of what
  you want, or a weakened version of the normal effect
- **Cursed tools** malfunction spectacularly. A cursed bag of
  holding *doubles* the weight of its contents instead of reducing
  it
- **Cursed food** is unpleasant but rarely fatal. Small mercies

#### Detecting Curses

Prevention is better than cure. Test items *before* wearing them:

- **Altar test.** Drop an item on an altar. A black flash means
  cursed. This is free, instant, and should become instinct
- **Pet test.** Your pet refuses to step on cursed items. Drop
  and observe
- **Temple priest.** Will identify BUC status for a fee—convenient
  in Minetown
- **Scroll of identify.** Always reveals the full status

#### Removing Curses

When prevention fails, you have three remedies:

- **Scroll of remove curse.** Uncursed removes curses from worn
  and wielded items. Blessed uncurses your entire inventory. The
  blessed version is one of the most relieving moments in NetHack
- **Holy water.** Dip a cursed item in holy water and it becomes
  uncursed. Simple, reliable, and reason enough to stockpile holy
  water
- **Prayer.** A pleased god uncurses your worn items as a side
  benefit of answering prayer. Don't waste a prayer solely on this,
  but it's a nice bonus

The lesson: always carry holy water and a scroll of remove curse.
The moment you find yourself stuck with cursed levitation boots
over a moat, you'll understand why veterans never leave home
without them.

---

### Luck and Fortune

The Mazes are rigged. Not unfairly — the dungeon doesn't *hate*
you — but there is a hidden number attached to your character that
quietly tilts every die roll, every prayer, every scroll, every
combat swing. It's called Luck, and it's one of the most important
stats you can't see.

Players who ignore Luck die to things that "shouldn't have happened."
Players who cultivate it find that the dungeon is mysteriously
generous. This is not a coincidence.

#### How Luck Works

Luck ranges from -13 to +13. It starts at 0, the universe's way of
saying "prove yourself." Left alone, luck drifts back toward zero
over time — the Mazes don't give anything for free.

**Luck timeout.** Every 600 turns, your luck moves one point toward
0. If you have +5 luck, it will drop to +4 after 600 turns, then
+3 after 1200, eventually reaching 0. Your good deeds are forgotten.
Your sins, alas, are also forgiven.

**Luckstone.** Carrying a luckstone in your open inventory
(not inside a container) freezes the timer. Your luck stays wherever
it is until something changes it. This is why getting the luckstone
from Mine's End is one of the first things every experienced player
does. It's a small gray stone that makes the universe remember you
fondly.

#### Gaining and Losing Luck

| Action                                   | Luck change |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Sacrificing on your own altar            | +1          |
| Identifying gems for a shopkeeper        | +1          |
| Sitting on a throne (lucky outcome)      | +1          |
| Going down stairs in Sokoban             | -1          |
| Breaking Sokoban rules (scroll of earth) | -1          |
| Killing a peaceful creature              | -1 to -5    |
| Attacking your pet                       | -1          |
| Cannibalism                              | -2 to -5    |

The pattern is consistent: be virtuous and the numbers smile on you.
Be a monster and they frown. The Mazes have a moral compass, and
it's embedded in the math.

#### Why Luck Matters

At Luck +5 (or higher, with a luckstone), life is *noticeably*
better:

- You hit more often in combat. Swings that would have missed
  connect instead.
- Your prayers are more likely to be answered. Your god likes
  lucky people. (Gods are fickle that way.)
- Scrolls of enchant weapon/armor succeed more often at high
  enchantment levels.
- Wands of wishing are more likely to work perfectly on wresting.
- Fountain wishes become slightly more likely.

At negative luck, all of these go wrong. At Luck -10 or worse,
prayer *always* fails and many items actively betray you. You'll
miss attacks you should have hit. Scrolls will backfire. The dungeon
becomes a place that is trying to kill you even harder than usual,
which is saying something.

The practical advice: get a luckstone early, sacrifice occasionally
to keep luck positive, and don't kill peacefuls. Treat the universe
well and it will return the favor — in the form of slightly better
random numbers, which in the Mazes is the closest thing to love.

## Part Six: The Deep Dungeon

---

### The Castle

If you've reached the Castle, congratulations: you've survived the
easy part. Everything below is worse.

The Castle sits at the bottom of the Dungeons of Doom, guarded by a
drawbridge and whatever the dungeon decided to stuff inside this
time. (In current editions, you're at least spared the welcoming
committee of arch-liches that used to greet you. Small mercies.) We
covered how to find and enter it in
[Branches and Landmarks](#branches-and-landmarks). Here's what
to do once the drawbridge is down and you're standing in the foyer
wondering what you've gotten yourself into.

The Castle contains:

- A **throne room** with a throne and guards. Sitting on the throne
  is tempting but risky (see
  [Points of Interest](#points-of-interest)).
- **Barracks** full of soldiers carrying decent equipment, which is
  to say *your* equipment once you've dealt with them.
- **Four outer rooms** along the north and south walls. One contains
  the **wand of wishing** in a chest. *Search them all.*
- A **maze section** with a minotaur guarding it. The minotaur hits
  hard but isn't especially resistant to having a wand pointed at it.

Strategy: clear the Castle carefully. A ring of conflict turns
the guards against each other — walk in, put on the ring, and let
the soldiers solve your monster problem for you. Loot everything.
Then use your wand of wishing to fill critical gaps in your
equipment (gray dragon scale mail, silver dragon scale mail,
gauntlets of power, speed boots — whatever you're missing).

Once you're fully equipped, the staircase down leads to Gehennom.
Take a moment before descending. Sit down. Have a snack. Check your
inventory twice. Make sure you have:

- Magic resistance
- Reflection
- Fire resistance
- Poison resistance
- A wand of digging
- A unicorn horn
- Plenty of food
- Holy water
- Scrolls of teleportation and identify
- Your quest artifact

If you're missing any of these, go back up and find them.

---

### Gehennom

Below the Castle, the dungeon changes. The corridors give way to
mazes. The monsters give way to demons. The comforting knowledge
that you can pray to your god for help gives way to silence—because
your god can't hear you in Gehennom. You are deeper than faith
reaches.

This is the part of the game that separates tourists from
ascenders. Everything you've prepared for has been leading here.

#### What's Different

- **No prayer.** Your god is deaf to you in Gehennom (unless you're
  a Moloch worshipper, and you're not). No emergency healing. No
  food rescue. No curse removal via divine intervention. Pack
  accordingly, because down here, you are completely on your own
- **Fire everywhere.** Fire traps litter the corridors. Demons
  breathe fire as casually as you breathe air. If you don't have
  fire resistance by now, turn around
- **Hot ground.** In current editions, the ground itself is hot
  enough to shatter potions dropped on the floor. Keep everything
  in a bag at all times
- **Demon lords.** Named demon lords—Orcus, Baalzebub, Asmodeus,
  Juiblex, Yeenoghu, and if you're very unlucky, Demogorgon—hold
  court on specific levels. Each is a major battle. Several can
  summon reinforcements. All of them are angry you're here
- **Teleportation restrictions.** In current editions, teleportation
  is blocked on a demon lord's lair level while that lord still
  lives. Kill or banish them and the restriction lifts. In older
  editions, most Gehennom levels permanently blocked teleportation
- **Mazes.** Nearly every level is a maze. A wand of digging or
  pickaxe isn't optional here—it's as essential as your weapon.
  Dig straight lines to the stairs and don't look back

#### Key Objectives in Gehennom

You're here for three artifacts, one ritual, and one extremely
dangerous robbery:

1. **Vlad's Tower.** A three-level tower where Vlad the Impaler
   (a vampire lord) guards the Candelabrum of Invocation at the
   top. Kill Vlad. Take the Candelabrum. Don't linger.

2. **The Wizard's Tower.** The Wizard of Yendor waits here with
   the Book of the Dead. He is the most dangerous enemy in the
   game—not because he's the strongest fighter, but because he
   never stops. He teleports, summons monsters, steals the Amulet,
   curses your gear, and once you wake him, he *will not leave you
   alone* for the rest of the game. Kill him. Take the Book.

3. **The vibrating square.** Somewhere on the level directly above
   Moloch's Sanctum, a single square vibrates when you step on it.
   This is the ritual site. Finding it in a maze is part of the
   challenge—scrolls of magic mapping help enormously.

4. **The Invocation.** At the vibrating square, light the
   Candelabrum (with 7 candles attached), ring the Bell of Opening,
   and read the Book of the Dead. The passage to Moloch's Sanctum
   opens.

5. **Moloch's Sanctum.** The high priest of Moloch guards the
   Amulet of Yendor. Defeat him and take it. Then turn around and
   realize you must carry it all the way back up through the entire
   dungeon you just descended.

#### Survival Tips

- **Bring extra food.** You can't pray for it
- **Bring scrolls of remove curse.** You can't pray curses away
- **Dig, don't navigate.** Maze walls are faster to go through
  than around
- **Kill the Wizard quickly.** Every turn he lives is another
  summoned monster, another stolen item, another cursed piece of
  gear. He'll come back—he always comes back—but the intervals
  between his appearances give you breathing room
- **The Amulet anchors you.** Level teleportation doesn't work
  while you carry it. Every step back to the surface must be
  climbed by foot

---

### The Ascension Run

You did it. You fought through Gehennom, defeated the High Priest,
and snatched the Amulet of Yendor from Moloch's Sanctum. Now all
you have to do is carry it from the absolute bottom of the dungeon,
through every level of Gehennom, past every demon lord you thought
you were done with, all the way back to the surface, and then
through the Elemental Planes to the Astral Plane where your god
awaits. Easy, right?

This is the Ascension Run: the victory lap that kills more
adventurers than anything else in the game. You have the most
powerful artifact in the dungeon in your pack, every covetous
monster in the Mazes knows it, and the dungeon itself is fighting
to keep you from leaving. It's the most exhilarating and terrifying
part of the game.

#### The Problems

Everything that can go wrong will try:

- **The Wizard of Yendor** periodically teleports to you, summoning
  nasty monsters and trying to steal the Amulet. He will not stop.
  Kill him each time; he always comes back. He is the world's most
  persistent ex.
- **The Amulet blocks teleportation.** You can't level teleport
  while carrying the Amulet. You must climb every single staircase
  from the bottom of Gehennom to the surface. All of them. By foot.
- **Covetous monsters.** Demon lords and the Wizard can warp
  directly to your position and attack. They specifically target you
  for the Amulet, because apparently everyone wants this thing.
- **The Mysterious Force.** While carrying the Amulet in Gehennom,
  each time you climb stairs, there's a chance you'll be yanked back
  to a random location on the level instead of going up. The dungeon
  is literally holding onto you. This stops once you're above
  Gehennom, where the dungeon's grip weakens.

#### Strategy

You are no longer an explorer. You are a running back carrying the
ball through the entire opposing team. Speed is everything.

- **Don't fight.** Don't explore. Don't loot. Just go up. Every
  turn you spend fighting something optional is a turn the Wizard
  gets closer to stealing the Amulet.
- **Dig.** Use your wand of digging to reach staircases quickly.
  Straight lines through walls beat wandering through corridors.
- **Zap problems away.** Teleportation wands move monsters out of
  your path. Death wands remove them permanently. Use both
  liberally.
- **Kill the Wizard fast.** When he shows up (and he will), don't
  try to be clever. Finger of death, wand of death, or brute force.
  The faster he's down, the fewer monsters he summons.
- **Use Elbereth** when you need a turn to heal, apply a unicorn
  horn, or just catch your breath.

The Ascension Run rewards preparation and punishes hesitation. If
you packed well at the Castle and your resistances are solid, this
is a sprint, not a marathon. Once you reach the top of the Dungeons
of Doom, the final staircase leads to the Elemental Planes — the
last obstacle between you and divinity.

---

### The Elemental Planes

Beyond the top of the Dungeons of Doom, the world dissolves into
its raw elements. Four planes stand between you and the gods, each
one a different flavor of hostile. There are no stairs here—only
magic portals, hidden somewhere in each level, leading to the next.
Find the portal. Survive the plane. Move on. There is no going back.

#### Plane of Earth

You arrive encased in solid rock and boulders, surrounded by earth
elementals that hit like the mountain itself. The portal is buried
somewhere in the level. Dig. A wand of digging is essential; a
scroll of magic mapping or crystal ball reveals the portal's
location so you can dig *toward* it instead of blind. This level
is claustrophobic, dark, and punishing—but it's the gentlest of
the four.

#### Plane of Air

The opposite extreme: an open void with no walls, no floor you can
feel, just empty sky and air elementals moving faster than thought.
They attack multiple times per turn and they cannot be genocided.
A ring of conflict is devastating here—let them tear each other
apart while you search for the portal. A scroll of magic mapping
reveals it. One strange trick: if a vortex engulfs you, it carries
you randomly around the level—and if it happens to cross the
portal, you're pulled through. Sometimes the fastest route is to
surrender to the wind.

#### Plane of Fire

Everything is on fire. The ground is fire. The air is fire. Fire
elementals fill the level, and fire traps dot every corridor. Fire
resistance isn't just recommended—without it, you'll be dead in
turns. Map the level, find the portal among the flames, and get
there. Don't stop to fight anything you don't have to.

#### Plane of Water

The entire level is underwater. Without magical breathing (an
amulet or intrinsic), you will drown—and drowning is instant death,
no saving throw. The level is a labyrinth of water-filled chambers
with occasional air pockets. Sea monsters prowl the corridors.
Find the portal and push through. This is the last barrier between
you and the gods.

#### The Astral Plane

You surface into the presence of the divine. Three altars stand in
the great temple: Lawful, Neutral, and Chaotic. You must sacrifice
the Amulet of Yendor on the altar matching your alignment to
ascend. Choose wrong and the Amulet is lost—you'll need to fight
to retrieve it.

The plane is swarming with Angels and the three Riders: Death,
Famine, and Pestilence. The Riders cannot be permanently killed—
they revive, they pursue, they do not stop. Don't try to clear
the level. You are not here to fight. You are here to reach one
altar, make one sacrifice, and end this.

- Conflict and teleportation wands clear a path through the crowds
- Identify the correct altar quickly—farlook (`;`) shows alignment
- The Riders will follow you. Outrun them, don't outfight them
- When you offer the Amulet on the correct altar: you ascend.
  The game is won. You've done what so few have done. Congratulations.

### Advanced Controls

Or: *How to Stop Typing the Same Thing Over and Over*

The basic commands get you through most situations: `h` moves west, `s` searches, `.` waits. But there's a layer of control built on top of these basics that experienced players use constantly. These are the commands that let you say "do that ten more times" or "fight even though you don't see anything" or "yes, I know I just typed that, do it again."

If you're new to NetHack, skip this section. Learn to walk before you learn to run. But if you've been playing for a while and you're tired of mashing the same key twenty times in a row, read on.

#### Command Counts (Multi-Digit Prefixes)

**The Problem:** You want to search the same spot ten times. You type `s` ten times. Your finger hurts. There must be a better way.

**The Solution:** Type `10s`. The dungeon will search ten times in a row, stopping early if something interesting happens (like finding a secret door, or a monster appearing, or your HP changing).

This works for any command. `20.` waits twenty turns. `5h` moves west five times. `99s` searches ninety-nine times (though you'll probably find the secret door before then, or conclude it doesn't exist).

**The Limits:** You can type up to five digits, for a maximum count of 32,767. If you type more, the count caps at 32,767. If you need to repeat something more than 32,767 times, you have bigger problems than this guide can solve.

**When It Stops:** Multi-command sequences are interrupted automatically when:
- A hostile monster appears adjacent to you
- Your HP changes (you take damage or heal)
- A `--More--` prompt appears

Press ESC to cancel a multi-command sequence early.

**Example:** Standing next to a likely secret door location, you type `10s`. The game searches once. Twice. Three times. On the fourth search: "You find a hidden door!" The sequence stops. You didn't type `s` ten times — you told the dungeon to search *up to* ten times, and it knew to stop when it found something.

#### Repeat Last Command (Ctrl+A)

**The Problem:** You searched. Nothing. You want to search again. You could type `s` again, but there must be a better way.

**The Solution:** Press **Ctrl+A**. The game repeats whatever you just did — same command, same count if you used one.

Searched once? Ctrl+A searches again. Moved west with `h`? Ctrl+A moves west again. Searched ten times with `10s`? Ctrl+A searches ten more times.

This is one of the most commonly used advanced commands. Once you learn it, you'll use it constantly. It's faster than retyping, and it works for *any* command.

**What It Remembers:** The last command you executed successfully. Not attempts that failed or were canceled — the last thing that actually happened.

**When to Use It:** Whenever you want to "do that again." Searching repeatedly. Moving in the same direction. Waiting multiple times. Reading the same scroll. (Okay, maybe not that last one.)

#### Prefix Commands (Command Modifiers)

Sometimes you want to modify how the next command behaves. NetHack has a system for this: type a prefix command, then type the command you want to modify. The prefix applies to the next command only, then clears.

##### Fight Prefix (`F`)

**What It Does:** Forces your next movement to attack, even if you don't see a monster there.

**When to Use It:**
- You suspect an invisible monster is adjacent
- A monster is displaced (you see it as being somewhere it isn't)
- You want to attack your own pet (please don't)

**Example:** You hear something breathing nearby, but you don't see anything. You type `Fh` (F, then h). Your character swings west. If there's an invisible monster there, you attack it. If not, you just move west normally.

**The Double-Press Cancel:** Type `F` twice in a row and it cancels. This applies to all prefix commands.

##### Run and Rush Prefixes (`G` and `g`)

**What They Do:**
- `G` (run): Next direction key runs until something interesting appears
- `g` (rush): Like run, but... honestly, in practice they work the same

This is an alternative to capital letters. `Gh` runs west. `H` also runs west. Use whichever you prefer.

**When to Use Them:** When you want to move quickly across explored territory. The run stops when you encounter:
- A monster
- An item you haven't seen before
- A trap
- A branch in the corridor
- A closed door

**Example:** You're in a long explored corridor. Type `Gh`. Your character runs west until the corridor ends or something interesting appears.

##### Modify Prefix (`m`)

**What It Does:** Modifies the next command. For movement, it means "move without attacking" (when implemented). For other commands, it may request a menu instead of a default action (when implemented).

**Current Status:** The `m` prefix is recognized but doesn't fully affect behavior yet. It's here for completeness and will be fully functional soon.

**When It Will Matter:** Once pets are more common, `m` will let you swap places with them without accidentally attacking. Once autopickup exists, `m` will let you move over items without picking them up.

#### Navigation Tips

**Capital Letters = Run:** `H` runs west. `J` runs south. `K` runs north. `L` runs east. The diagonals work too: `Y` runs northwest, `U` runs northeast, `B` runs southwest, `N` runs southeast.

**The Run Rule:** Running stops when something interesting appears. A monster. An item. A branch. A door. Anything that might require a decision. The dungeon is trying to help you not run into trouble.

**Arrow Keys:** Work like you'd expect. Arrow key movement also runs if you hold Shift, but capital letters are usually faster for experienced players.

#### Message History (Ctrl+P)

Press **Ctrl+P** to see the last message. Press it again to see the one before that. Keep pressing to scroll back through message history.

**When to Use It:** You saw something important flash by. A warning about poison. A monster's special ability. A shopkeeper's price quote. Ctrl+P lets you review it.

**The Limit:** Message history stores the last several dozen messages. Beyond that, they're gone. Write down the important ones.

#### Redraw Screen (Ctrl+R)

Press **Ctrl+R** to redraw the screen. Useful if your terminal gets garbled or if you suspect a display bug.

**When to Use It:** Rarely. But when you need it, you really need it.

#### The Learning Curve

You don't need to memorize all of these at once. Start with command counts (`10s`) and repeat last command (Ctrl+A). Those two alone will save you thousands of keystrokes over the course of a game.

The prefix commands can wait until you need them. The first time you suspect an invisible monster, you'll remember `F` exists and look it up. The first time you're running across a long corridor, you'll remember `G` or capital letters exist. Let the game teach you when the tools are useful.

The dungeon rewards efficiency, but it doesn't demand it on day one.

#### Related Options

Several options affect how commands and controls work. Access them with the `O` command (that's capital O, not zero).

**`number_pad`**: Enables numeric keypad for movement (1-9 for directions). Off by default. If you enable this, digit prefixes for command counts work differently — you'll need to press `n` first to enter a count.

**`autopickup`**: When implemented, this will make you automatically pick up certain items when you walk over them. The `m` prefix will let you move over items without triggering autopickup. Currently not yet implemented in this version.

**`DECgraphics`**: Changes how walls and corridors are drawn. Doesn't affect controls, but might affect how quickly you can read the map.

**`verbose`**: Controls whether the game gives you detailed messages. When on, interruptions to multi-command sequences explain *why* they stopped.

**`msg_window`**: Lets you see multiple messages at once in a dedicated message window, rather than one message at a time on the status line. Extremely useful for reviewing what just happened without Ctrl+P.

The options system is deep and intimidating. Don't worry about most of them when starting out. The defaults are reasonable. But if you find yourself annoyed by some aspect of the interface, check the options — there's probably a setting for it.

### Sokoban Solutions

Sokoban is a four-level boulder puzzle branch that goes *up* from
its entrance. Each level has two possible layouts, chosen randomly.
You push boulders onto pits to fill them and create a path to the
next staircase. The penalty for cheating (phasing through walls,
levitating over pits, destroying boulders) is a −1 Luck penalty
per infraction, and it stacks. Play fair.

In the maps below, boulders are labeled A through T so the
solutions can reference them. The `^` symbols mark pits; `<` marks
the upstairs. Your starting position is marked `@`.

After solving a level, push leftover boulders into corners so they
can't block you if you return later. Items sometimes hide under
boulders.

**A note on mirroring.** In the current edition of the game,
Sokoban levels may be flipped horizontally and/or vertically.
The solutions still work — just mirror the directions.

### Voluntary Challenges

> *The conduct system is documented in Dion Nicolaas's Conduct
> Spoiler, originally posted to RGRN and archived at steelypips.org.
> The information below has been updated for the current edition of
> the Mazes.*

The game tracks a set of optional self-imposed restrictions called
**conducts**. You can check which ones you've maintained at any time
with `#conduct`. When you die or ascend, the end-of-game summary
lists every conduct you kept. No conduct is required for victory;
they exist for players who want a harder game or a more impressive
ascension.

Conducts are not declared in advance. The game simply watches your
actions and records whether you've broken each restriction. If you
eat a corpse on turn 1, you've broken foodless, vegan, and
vegetarian for the rest of the run. There's no going back.

#### The Food Conducts

These form a hierarchy: foodless is stricter than vegan, which is
stricter than vegetarian.

**Vegetarian.** Don't eat meat. Specifically, don't eat the corpses
of non-vegetarian monsters, and avoid items made from animal
products (meat sticks, eggs from carnivorous creatures). In
practice, this means living on permissible corpses (lichens, most
blobs, brown and yellow puddings, shriekers, and many others),
fortune cookies, lembas wafers, and whatever food you find on the
ground. The vegetarian monster list is broader than you might
expect: all `b` (blobs), all `j` (jellies), all `F` (fungi and
molds), all `v` (vortices), all `y` (lights), all `E` (elementals)
except stalkers, all `'` (golems) except flesh golems and leather
golems, and all ghosts. Most puddings are also vegetarian.

**Vegan.** Follow all vegetarian restrictions, plus avoid eggs,
pancakes, lumps of royal jelly, cream pies, candy bars, and anything
involving wax, leather, or bone. This eliminates many useful items:
no wax candles for Vlad's Tower (use tallow or find oil lamps), no
leather armor unless you can avoid eating it while polymorphed.
Vegan monsters are a subset of the vegetarian list, excluding
puddings and a few others.

**Foodless.** Don't eat anything at all. This is one of the hardest
conducts in the game. Your only nutrition sources are prayer (which
cures hunger when you're Weak or Fainting), the spell of stone to
flesh on rocks in your inventory (which creates meatballs, but
eating them breaks the conduct), and a ring of slow digestion (which
stops nutrition loss entirely). Most foodless runs rely on finding a
ring of slow digestion early or praying through hunger until one
appears. Polymorphing and chewing through walls also breaks this
conduct.

#### Atheist

Don't interact with the divine. Specifically: don't `#pray`, don't
`#offer` corpses at altars, don't `#turn` undead, and don't `#chat`
with priests. This removes your safety net for starvation, stoning,
illness, and cursed items. You'll need to solve every problem through
items and knowledge alone.

Atheist runs require careful resource management. Without prayer to
cure hunger, you need reliable food sources. Without sacrifice, you
get no artifact gifts. Without BUC testing on altars (you can still
use them passively by dropping items on an altar), identification is
harder. The reward is a particularly satisfying ascension.

#### Weaponless

Never hit a monster with a wielded weapon. You can throw weapons,
fire them from bows and crossbows, and use wands and spells. You
can also fight bare-handed or with martial arts (Monks excel here).
What you cannot do is swing a sword, axe, mace, or any other weapon
in melee while it's in your `w`ielded slot.

This is less restrictive than it sounds. Monks start with strong
martial arts and get better. Other classes can rely on spells,
wands, and thrown daggers. A wielded cockatrice corpse still works
(it's not a weapon). The main sacrifice is giving up the damage
output of late-game artifact weapons.

#### Pacifist

Don't kill any monsters. Not directly, not with pets, not through
any means that the game attributes to you. This is one of the most
demanding conducts. You'll rely on pets to do your fighting, on
conflict to make monsters attack each other, on Elbereth to keep
them at bay, and on creative use of the dungeon environment.

Pacifist ascensions are possible but require deep knowledge of the
game's mechanics. Most pacifist players use a large, well-trained
pet (often polymorphed into a purple worm or similar), the spell
of charm monster, and extremely patient tactics.

#### Illiterate

Don't read anything. No scrolls, no spellbooks, no fortune cookies,
no T-shirts, no gravestones. You can still write (engraving is
fine), and you can use scrolls by other means (such as having a
pet step on a scroll of teleportation). Blank scrolls and
spellbooks don't count against you.

Without scrolls, you lose access to identify, enchant weapon/armor,
teleportation, remove curse, and genocide in their most common
forms. Without spellbooks, you have no spells. This forces extreme
reliance on wands, potions, and creative workarounds.

#### No Genocide

Never genocide any monster. When offered genocide (through a scroll
or the Astral Plane's final wish), answer "none" or leave it blank.
This means you'll face the full bestiary throughout the game,
including master and arch-liches, mind flayers, cockatrices, and
everything else that experienced players routinely eliminate.

This is one of the milder conducts, since many players ascend
without genociding anything simply because they never find the
scroll. But deliberately maintaining it against late-game threats
takes discipline.

#### Polymorph Restrictions

Two related conducts track polymorphing:

**No polymorph.** Never polymorph yourself. Avoid polymorph traps,
don't quaff potions of polymorph, don't wear a ring of polymorph,
and don't read a cursed scroll of polymorph. This locks you into
your starting form for the entire game, forgoing the advantages of
powerful monster forms (master mind flayer, xorn, various dragons).

**No polymorph objects.** Never polymorph items. Don't zap items
with a wand of polymorph, don't dip items in potions of polymorph,
and avoid other means of transforming objects. This eliminates a
powerful item-generation strategy (polypiling) that many players use
to obtain specific high-value items.

#### Wishing Restrictions

Two related conducts:

**Wishless.** Never make a wish. Refuse wishes from wands, fountains,
thrones, and all other sources. This is extremely challenging because
wishes are the primary way to obtain critical items (silver dragon
scale mail, speed boots, a bag of holding) when the dungeon doesn't
provide them. Wishless players must make do with whatever the random
number generator provides.

**No wishing for artifacts.** Make wishes, but never wish for an
artifact. This prevents the most efficient wish strategy (wishing
for Grayswandir, the Eye of the Aethiopica, or similar game-changing
artifacts) while still allowing wishes for mundane necessities.

#### Combining Conducts

The real prestige comes from combining multiple conducts. A
vegetarian atheist run is substantially harder than either alone.
A pacifist illiterate vegan foodless atheist weaponless run is
the stuff of legends (and has been done). The game's end screen
lists all maintained conducts, and the community has long
celebrated players who push the boundaries of what's possible
within self-imposed constraints.

Recent editions of the Mazes have added several more tracked
conducts:

**Nudist.** Never wear any armor, shirt, cloak, gloves, boots,
helmet, or shield. Set the `nudist` option at game start. You
fight the entire dungeon in your underwear. Officially tracked
since version 3.6.0.

**Blind (Zen).** Play the entire game without sight. Set the
`blind` option at game start. You'll need telepathy and other
senses to navigate. Officially tracked since version 3.6.0.

**Pauper.** A starting handicap enabled via the `pauper` option.
You begin with no starting equipment, skills, or item
discoveries. It cannot be broken mid-game — you either started
pauper or you didn't.

**Petless.** Never have a pet at any point. Start by disabling
pets in your options. No taming spells, no charm monster, no
figurines. You fight every battle yourself.

**Permadeaf.** Play the entire game while deaf, set via the `deaf`
option. You get no audio cues — no "you hear some noises"
warnings, no shop announcements, no prayer feedback sounds.

**Sokoban.** Complete Sokoban without cheating — no phasing through
walls, no levitating over boulders, no teleporting. Just honest
puzzle-solving.

Your `#conduct` screen also tracks whether you've used an amulet
of life saving, which some players consider an informal conduct
of its own.

Shops are one of the most useful features of the dungeon. Beyond
buying and selling items, their pricing system provides a powerful
identification tool: by comparing what a shopkeeper charges for an
unidentified item against known base prices, you can often determine
exactly what it is.

#### How Prices Work

Every item in the game has a **base price** in zorkmids. This is
the starting point for all shop transactions. The actual price you
see depends on several modifiers applied in sequence.

**List price** starts with the base price, then adjusts for:

- **Enchantment:** Each point of positive enchantment adds 10 zm to
  the base price. Negative enchantment has no effect on price.
- **Charges:** An empty wand (0 charges) is worth less. A wand that
  has been recharged reduces the base price in proportion.
- **Erosion:** Rusted, corroded, burnt, or rotted items sell for
  less.
- **Artifacts:** Artifact items have their base price multiplied by
  25. This makes them extraordinarily expensive to buy but also
  easy to identify by price.

**Buying price** adds further markups to the list price:

- **Tourist surcharge:** Tourists pay a 33% markup (the "sucker"
  tax). This applies only to the Tourist class.
- **Charisma modifier:** Your Charisma stat adjusts prices
  significantly:

| Charisma | Buy modifier | Sell modifier |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| 3–5      | ×2.00       | ×0.50         |
| 6–7      | ×1.67       | ×0.60         |
| 8–10     | ×1.33       | ×0.75         |
| 11–15    | ×1.00       | ×1.00         |
| 16–17    | ×0.75       | ×1.33         |
| 18       | ×0.67       | ×1.50         |
| 19+      | ×0.50       | ×2.00         |

- **Angry shopkeeper:** If you've angered the shopkeeper (by
  stealing, attacking, or similar offenses), prices increase by 33%.
- **Random variation:** About one time in four, an unidentified
  non-gem item gets a 33% random surcharge. In current editions,
  this surcharge is fixed per shopkeeper — the same shopkeeper
  will always give you the same price for the same unidentified
  item, so you can't exploit price variation by repeatedly dropping
  and picking up items.

**Selling price** is simpler. Identified items sell for half the
list price. Unidentified items sell for one-third. This means
identifying items before selling them is worth a 50% profit
increase.

#### Price Identification

The most valuable use of shop pricing is identifying unknown items.
When you pick up an unidentified item in a shop, the shopkeeper
announces a price. Working backward from that price to the base
price tells you what the item is.

The process:

1. Note the shopkeeper's asking price.
2. Divide by your Charisma modifier (from the table above).
3. Account for the tourist surcharge if applicable.
4. If the result doesn't match a known base price, the item may have
   the 33% random surcharge. Divide by 1.33 and check again.
5. Compare the resulting base price to the known prices for that item
   class.

For example: a shopkeeper asks 80 zm for an unidentified scroll,
and your Charisma is 12 (modifier ×1.00). The base price is either
80 zm or, after removing a possible 33% surcharge, 60 zm. Checking
the scroll price table: 80 zm scrolls are enchant armor and
remove curse—both excellent. A 60 zm scroll is blank paper or
enchant weapon. Either way, you've narrowed the possibilities
dramatically.

**Common base prices by item class:**

*Scrolls:* 20 zm (identify), 50 zm (light), 60 zm (blank paper,
enchant weapon), 80 zm (enchant armor, remove curse), 100 zm
(confuse monster, destroy armor, fire, food detection, gold
detection, magic mapping, scare monster, teleportation), 200 zm
(amnesia, create monster, earth, taming), 300 zm (charging,
genocide, punishment, stinking cloud).

*Potions:* 50 zm (booze, fruit juice, see invisible, sickness),
100 zm (confusion, extra healing, hallucination, healing, restore
ability, sleeping, water), 150 zm
(blindness, gain energy, invisibility, monster detection, object
detection), 200 zm (enlightenment, full healing, levitation,
polymorph, speed), 250 zm (acid, oil), 300 zm (gain ability, gain
level, paralysis).

*Wands:* 100 zm (light, nothing), 150 zm (digging, enlightenment,
locking, magic missile, make invisible, opening, probing, secret
door detection, slow monster, speed monster, striking, undead
turning), 175 zm (cold, fire, lightning, sleep), 200 zm
(cancellation, create monster, polymorph, teleportation), 500 zm
(death, wishing).

*Rings:* 100 zm (adornment, hunger, protection, protection from
shape changers, stealth, sustain ability, warning), 150 zm
(aggravate monster, cold resistance, gain constitution, gain
strength, increase accuracy, increase damage, invisibility, poison
resistance, see invisible, shock resistance), 200 zm (fire
resistance, free action, levitation, regeneration, searching, slow
digestion, teleportation), 300 zm (conflict, polymorph,
polymorph control, teleport control).

#### Gem Identification Through Selling

Gems deserve special mention. When you sell unidentified gems to a
shopkeeper, the price depends on whether the gem is valuable or
worthless glass. More importantly, different shopkeepers pay slightly
different amounts for the same worthless glass, while valuable gems
always sell consistently. By selling the same unidentified gem at
two different shops and comparing prices, you can determine whether
it's genuine.

Alternatively, a touchstone (gray stone, base price 45 zm)
identifies gems directly: rubbing a hard gem against it produces
a streak that names the gem.

#### Credit and Debt

Shopkeepers maintain a credit and debt system:

- **Credit** accumulates when you sell items or drop gold in the
  shop. Credit applies against future purchases.
- **Debt** accrues if you use unpaid items within the shop (reading
  a scroll, quaffing a potion, zapping a wand). You're charged a
  fraction of the item's purchase price.
- Leaving the shop with unpaid items makes the shopkeeper hostile.
  The Keystone Kops will pursue you through the dungeon. The
  shopkeeper is a formidable fighter and should not be engaged
  lightly.

#### Shopkeeper Behavior

Shopkeepers are among the toughest NPCs in the game. They have high
hit points, good armor class, and they hit hard. A few things to
know:

- Shopkeepers block the door when you have unpaid items.
- They track everything you pick up and everything that enters their
  shop.
- If you break something in the shop (a potion, a wand), you pay
  for it.
- Telepathically, shopkeepers know their inventory. Even invisible
  theft is detected.
- Shopkeepers can be killed for their entire stock and gold
  inventory, but this carries significant penalties (Keystone Kops,
  alignment loss) and forfeits all future service from that shop.

The best strategy is usually to play fair: sell what you don't need,
buy what you do, and use the pricing system to identify as much as
possible before spending your gold on scrolls of identify.

### What Changed Since Last Time

If you're an experienced traveler returning after some time away, the
current edition of the Mazes includes several notable changes from the
version you may remember. The most significant:

- **Themed rooms** are now a regular feature of dungeon generation.
  You'll encounter rooms with specific monster or item themes that
  didn't exist before.
- **Four new monster species**: the displacer beast, genetic
  engineer, gold dragon, and baby gold dragon now roam the Mazes.
- **The helm of caution** is a new piece of armor that grants
  warning. The helm of brilliance now always appears as a
  "crystal helmet" rather than a randomized appearance.
- **Chain lightning** is a new level 7 attack spell.
- **Spell maintenance** drains maximum power while spells are
  memorized, making it costly to hoard too many spells.
- **Spellbooks** can be `a`pplied to check how worn they are.
- **Mind flayers** no longer cause amnesia (they still drain
  Intelligence, which can still kill you).
- **Unicorn horns** no longer restore lost attributes. This is a
  major change. In previous editions, the unicorn horn was a
  cure-all; now you'll need other solutions.
- **Dragon scale mail** now provides two extrinsic resistances
  instead of one. This makes it even more desirable.
- **Bags of holding** no longer destroy their contents on explosion.
  Items are scattered on the floor instead, which is bad but not
  catastrophic.
- **Loadstones** now confer steadfastness (resistance to forced
  movement), giving them a niche use if you can keep one uncursed.
- **Sacrifice** for artifact generation now requires a minimum
  sacrifice value.
- **Gehennom** levels are more varied and interesting.
- **Medusa's Island** now has four possible layouts.
- **Special levels** can now generate mirrored (flipped), so don't
  rely on fixed maps.
- **Elbereth** now incurs a −5 alignment penalty when you attack
  a monster while standing on it.
- **New conducts** are tracked: pauper, petless, permadeaf, and
  Sokoban (no cheating).
- **Touch of death** has been reworked: instead of binary kill,
  it now deals heavy damage and drains max HP. Magic resistance
  reduces but no longer fully prevents it.
- **Black dragons** now have a passive disintegration attack.
  Black dragon scale mail also grants drain resistance.
- **Green dragon scale mail** now grants sickness immunity.
- **New wish sources**: Vlad's throne is guaranteed, and the
  Amulet of Yendor grants a wish on pickup. Either a magic lamp
  or magic marker is guaranteed in Orcus-town.
- **Charm monster** is now level 5 (was 3). **Sleep** is now
  level 3 (was 1). **Confuse monster** is now level 1 (was 2).
- **Cursed wands** may explode when used to engrave.
- **Monsters** can now use containers and unlock chests.
- **Valkyries** no longer start with a long sword. They start with
  a spear, making the Excalibur strategy less immediate.
- **Excalibur** fountain dipping is much harder for non-Knights:
  1/30 chance per dip instead of the Knight's 1/6.
- **Magic cancellation** was overhauled in 3.6.0. The cloak of
  magic resistance is now MC1 (was MC3). The cloak of protection is
  the only single item providing MC3. MC3 now blocks 90% (was 98%).
- **New amulets**: the amulet of flying grants flight, and the
  amulet of guarding provides +2 AC and +2 MC.
- **Minetown** has a 1/7 chance of generating as Orcish Town,
  with no shops and no priest.
- **Blessed potions of polymorph** now grant controlled polymorph,
  eliminating the need for polymorph control when using blessed
  potions.
- **Gehennom** has hot ground that can shatter dropped potions.
  Teleportation is now blocked only while a demon lord is present,
  not permanently.
- **Wand of speed monster** no longer grants permanent speed when
  self-zapped; use potions of speed instead.
- **Supply containers** now appear on early dungeon levels,
  containing useful items like healing potions and enchant scrolls.
- **Pets** can gain resistances from eating corpses, and dead pets
  can be revived by praying at a co-aligned altar while standing
  on their corpse.
- **Sink dipping** is new: you can dip items or pour potions down
  a sink to identify them by their effects.
- **Demonbane** is now a silver mace (was a long sword) and is the
  guaranteed first sacrifice gift for Priests.
- **Two-handed weapons** get a 50% increase to the strength damage
  bonus, making them more competitive with dual-wielding.
- **HP regeneration** uses a new formula: (experience level +
  Constitution)% chance per turn. The regeneration intrinsic now
  heals 1 HP unconditionally every turn on top of natural regen.
- **Covetous monsters** (demon lords, liches) now warp to either
  upstairs or downstairs when fleeing to heal, not always upstairs.
- **Alchemy** is nerfed: diluted potion stacks only alchemize 2
  potions instead of the whole stack. Wearing an alchemy smock
  reduces the random blast chance to 1/30.
- **Glass items** (crystal ball, crystal plate mail) now crack in
  stages instead of instantly shattering, and can be made
  crackproof.
- **Candle light radius** now uses a square root formula: more
  candles in a stack give more light than before.
- **The Castle** no longer generates master liches or arch-liches
  at level creation, making it significantly less dangerous on
  arrival.
- **Corpses, tins, and eggs** from intrinsic-granting monsters
  now have higher shop prices, making price identification of tins
  and eggs possible.
- **Monsters** no longer drop food items as death drops (except
  their own corpse), reducing food availability in the early game.
- **Iron bars** are a dungeon feature (since 3.6.0). They can be
  dissolved with acid or broken with a war hammer.
- **Mummies** now cause withering instead of draining experience.
  Withering can be cured by prayer.

### Acknowledgements

NetHack has been played, cursed at, loved, and documented since
1987. The game itself is the work of the NetHack DevTeam, a
loose collective of developers who have maintained one of the
longest-running open source projects in existence. But the
documentation, the strategy, the collected wisdom about how to
actually survive the thing, that came from the players.

In the early days, knowledge spread through Usenet, specifically
the newsgroup **rec.games.roguelike.nethack** (RGRN). Thousands
of players posted questions, argued about strategy, and slowly
assembled a shared body of knowledge about a game that refused to
explain itself. This was before wikis, before Reddit, before
Discord. If you wanted to know whether a cockatrice corpse could
be wielded as a weapon, you searched the RGRN archives and hoped
someone had asked before you. Someone usually had.

Out of those conversations came the first spoiler files: plain text
documents that attempted to catalog every item, every monster, every
interaction. They were written by hand, cross-referenced against the
source code, and shared freely. They represented hundreds of hours
of work by people who simply loved the game and wanted to help
others play it.

This guide stands on their work. Specifically:

**Kevin Hugo** compiled the first comprehensive spoiler set for
NetHack 3.2.2, covering every item class, monster stat, spell
formula, and score calculation in methodical detail. **Dylan
O'Donnell** updated the entire set for 3.4.3, correcting, expanding,
and maintaining the files over several years. Together, the
Hugo/O'Donnell spoilers became the definitive reference: 38 files
covering potions, scrolls, wands, rings, amulets, tools, weapons,
armor, artifacts, food, monsters, spells, and more. The item data
tables throughout Parts Four and Five of this guide are verified
against their work. Published under BSD-like terms.

**Paul Waterman** wrote the WCST NetHack Spoilers (originally the
"World's Encyclopaedia of NetHack"), a single sprawling document
that covered the entire game in a conversational, opinionated voice.
Where Hugo and O'Donnell wrote reference manuals, the WCST was
a travel guide. It told you not just what things did but what to do
about them. It was the original inspiration for the tone and
structure of this guide, though no text has been copied from it.

**Kate Nepveu** maintained steelypips.org, the web archive that
preserved the Hugo/O'Donnell spoilers, the RGRN community articles,
and her own excellent guides (including the Elbereth FAQ cited in
our traps chapter). Without Kate's patient archival work, much of
this material might have disappeared when Usenet faded.

The following **RGRN community authors** contributed articles,
FAQs, and guides that informed specific sections of this guide:

**David Damerell** wrote the Object Identification FAQ, the
original systematic guide to figuring out what you've found
without wasting scrolls of identify.
**Kieron Dunbar** wrote the wand identification guide, laying
out the engrave-test method that remains the fastest way to sort
wands.
**Trevor Powell** compiled the Instadeath Spoiler, the definitive
catalog of ways to die in a single turn, cited in our Dangerous
Encounters chapter.
**Arien Malec** wrote the Medusa guide, collecting crossing
strategies from dozens of RGRN posters and organizing them into
a clear checklist.
**Matthew Lahut** wrote the prayer guide that untangled the
timeout and alignment systems.
**Boudewijn Waijers** mapped solutions for all eight Sokoban
level variants.
**Steven Bush** calculated spellbook reading success rates.
**Gregory Bond** documented shopkeeper pricing formulas.
**Dion Nicolaas** cataloged the voluntary challenge conducts.
**David Goldfarb** wrote the air elemental FAQ.
**Hojita Discordia** documented experience value calculations.

And many others: Ray Chason, Pat Rankin, Geoduck, Topi Linkala,
Geoffrey Eadon, Roger Broadbent, Sebastian Haas, Jukka Lahtinen,
and the countless anonymous posters on RGRN who asked "has anyone
tried..." and then reported back.

**The NetHack Wiki** (nethackwiki.com) has been an indispensable
reference for this guide. Founded as "WikiHack" by Sgeo in 2005,
it migrated to its own domain in 2010 and now contains over five
thousand articles documenting every corner of the game. Its
creators and maintainers include Pasi Kallinen, Drew Streib,
Alex Smith, Shawn Moore, George Koehler, Tjr, ZeroOne, and
Ray Chason. The wiki is hosted alongside nethack.alt.org, the
longest-running public NetHack server.

**The r/nethack community** on Reddit has kept NetHack discussion
alive for a new generation of players. Its moderators over the
years have maintained a welcoming space where veterans and newcomers
trade advice, share ascension stories, and argue about optimal wish
choices. The community's collective knowledge, passed along in
thousands of threads, has informed the practical advice throughout
this guide.

Above all, this guide exists because the game itself exists.
**NetHack** has been continuously developed since 1987 by the
NetHack DevTeam, founded by Mike Stephenson, Izchak Miller, and
Janet Walz. Izchak Miller passed away in 1994; the shopkeeper
who bears his name in the Mines is a small measure of how much
his work meant. The current team of sixteen, including Michael
Allison, Ken Arromdee, David Cohrs, Jessie Collet, Pasi Kallinen,
Ken Lorber, Dean Luick, Patric Mueller, Pat Rankin, Derek S. Ray,
Alex Smith, Mike Stephenson, Janet Walz, Paul Winner, Bart House,
and Warwick Allison, has maintained and extended the game across
nearly four decades. Everything in these pages is downstream of
their work.

This is what a community looks like over decades. People writing
things down so that others don't have to die the same stupid death.
It's generous, it's nerdy, and it's one of the best things about
NetHack.

All data in this guide has been verified against the current game
source code. Any errors are ours alone.
