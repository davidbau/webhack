<h2 id="before-you-read-further">Before You Read Further</h2>
<p>You are holding (or more likely scrolling through) a guide to the Mazes of Menace, the vast and ever-shifting dungeon complex that sits beneath a place the locals just call “the dungeon entrance.” What lies below is one of the oldest and most treacherous adventure destinations in existence: dozens of levels of corridors, vaults, and special chambers, stretching from the relatively tame upper mines all the way down to the molten depths of Gehennom and beyond.</p>
<p>People have been descending into these depths for decades. Most of them died. The ones who made it back brought stories, and some of those stories eventually got written down. You’re reading the latest edition of that accumulated lore.</p>
<p><strong>A word of caution.</strong> This guide will change how you experience the Mazes forever. Once you know that a floating eye can paralyze you with a glance, you can never un-know it. Once you learn what a cockatrice corpse can do when wielded with gloves, the dungeon becomes a different place. Some adventurers prefer the thrill of discovery over the comfort of preparation. If that’s you, close this guide now and go learn things the hard way. There is real joy in that.</p>
<p>But if you’ve died to one too many rubber-banded acid blobs, or you’re tired of starving on dungeon level four because you didn’t know you could pray – read on. We’ll do our best to keep you alive.</p>

<hr />
<h3 id="choosing-your-expedition">Choosing Your Expedition</h3>
<p>The first decision you’ll make, before you even set foot on the stairs, is who you are. In the Mazes, this means three things: your <strong>role</strong>, your <strong>race</strong>, and your <strong>alignment</strong>. Together, these determine your starting equipment, your natural abilities, which gods hear your prayers, and which artifacts you can safely handle.</p>
<p>Don’t agonize over this choice too much on your first few trips. You will die regardless, and each death teaches something. But if you’d like a recommendation for a first expedition, read on.</p>
<h4 id="the-roles">The Roles</h4>
<p>There are thirteen roles available to adventurers. Each comes with different starting equipment, different intrinsic abilities gained at various experience levels, and a different quest to complete in the mid-game.</p>
<p><strong>Archeologist.</strong> You start with a bullwhip, a pickaxe, and a tinning kit. The pickaxe is quietly one of the best starting items in the game: it lets you dig through walls and create your own escape routes from the very first level. The tinning kit lets you preserve corpses for later. Archeologists are capable and flexible, though a bit fragile in early combat. You begin knowing what all gems are, which is a nice parlor trick and occasionally useful for unicorn negotiation. <em>Alignment: Lawful or Neutral.</em></p>
<p><strong>Barbarian.</strong> You start strong. Literally. A two-handed sword and good starting strength mean you can hack through early monsters with ease. The downside is that two-handed weapons prevent you from using a shield, and Barbarians are not known for their finesse. You do get poison resistance from the start, which saves you from several common early deaths. A straightforward role for players who like straightforward solutions. <em>Alignment: Neutral or Chaotic.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cave Dweller.</strong> You start primitive but tough, with a club and some rocks for throwing. You gain speed early and your hit dice are generous. The Cave Dweller’s simplicity is a virtue: fewer tools means fewer things to manage. <em>Alignment: Lawful or Neutral.</em></p>
<p><strong>Healer.</strong> You begin with a stethoscope, healing potions, and poison resistance. The stethoscope is remarkable: it lets you check a monster’s hit points and your own internal state. Healers are fragile fighters, but their medical knowledge keeps them alive through situations that would kill other roles. You can also see whether potions of sickness are safe, which streamlines identification considerably. <em>Alignment: Neutral.</em></p>
<p><strong>Knight.</strong> You start mounted on a pony, which is both a blessing and a liability. The pony is a decent combatant early on but will get you into trouble if it wanders into a shop. Knights follow a code of conduct that penalizes attacking fleeing or peaceful monsters. You get a lance for jousting from horseback, which is very effective when it works. <em>Alignment: Lawful.</em></p>
<p><strong>Monk.</strong> You fight best with bare hands and start with no weapon at all, which is the point. Monks gain martial arts abilities as they level, eventually becoming formidable unarmed combatants. You start with sleep resistance and see invisible, and you should avoid eating meat if you want to maintain your spiritual discipline. One of the more unusual roles, rewarding for experienced players. <em>Alignment: Any.</em></p>
<p><strong>Priest.</strong> You start with holy (or unholy) water and the ability to intuitively sense whether items are blessed, cursed, or uncursed. This is enormously useful. You know immediately whether that cloak you just found is safe to wear. Priests are competent fighters with access to clerical spells and begin with a mace. <em>Alignment: Any (matches your god).</em></p>
<p><strong>Ranger.</strong> You start with a bow and a generous supply of arrows, making you one of the strongest ranged combatants early on. Rangers get stealth and see invisible early. Your elven racial option gives you sleep resistance on top of that. If you enjoy picking off enemies from a distance, this is your role. <em>Alignment: Neutral or Chaotic.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rogue.</strong> You start with a short sword, daggers for throwing, and a sack. You get stealth from the beginning and your backstab ability deals extra damage when you attack from hiding. Rogues are excellent at avoiding trouble, which is often better than being good at surviving it. <em>Alignment: Chaotic.</em></p>
<p><strong>Samurai.</strong> You start with a katana, which is one of the better one-handed weapons in the game, plus a wakizashi backup and a yumi bow with arrows. Samurai get speed early and have a strong martial kit overall. The katana’s damage output carries you through the early game with ease. <em>Alignment: Lawful.</em></p>
<p><strong>Tourist.</strong> You start with a Hawaiian shirt, a credit card, a camera, and a truly absurd number of darts. Tourists are deliberately designed to be the hardest role in the game. Your starting equipment is mostly a joke, your combat abilities are poor, and the dungeon seems to know it. That said, the darts are actually useful for training ranged skills, and the camera can blind monsters in a pinch. A role for people who have ascended before and want a challenge. <em>Alignment: Neutral.</em></p>
<p><strong>Valkyrie.</strong> You start with a long sword, a small shield, and cold resistance. Valkyries are widely considered one of the most beginner-friendly roles: strong combat stats, good starting equipment, and cold resistance covers one of the more common damage types. If you’re lawful, you can dip your long sword in a fountain at experience level 5 or higher for a chance at Excalibur. This is the recommendation for your first serious attempt. <em>Alignment: Lawful or Neutral.</em></p>
<p><strong>Wizard.</strong> You start with a quarterstaff and a spellbook or two. Your physical combat is terrible, but you have access to the deepest magic in the game. Wizards are extremely powerful in the late game but very fragile early on. You’ll lean heavily on your spells and need to find ways to avoid melee combat until you’re strong enough to dominate it. If you enjoy resource management and creative problem-solving, the Wizard is deeply satisfying. <em>Alignment: Neutral or Chaotic.</em></p>
<h4 id="the-races">The Races</h4>
<p>Your race affects your starting attributes, maximum attributes, and which intrinsics you begin with or can gain.</p>
<p><strong>Human.</strong> You know what a human is. No infravision, no poison resistance, no particular talents. On the bright side, every role is open to you, and nobody in the dungeon singles you out for being one. Perfectly serviceable.</p>
<p><strong>Dwarf.</strong> Dwarves are sturdy and strong, with infravision (they can see warm-blooded creatures in the dark). They’re good fighters and have an affinity for mining. Available for: Archeologist, Cave Dweller, Valkyrie.</p>
<p><strong>Elf.</strong> Elves get sleep resistance, infravision, and a natural affinity for bows. They’re a bit more fragile than humans but have excellent dexterity. Available for: Ranger, Wizard.</p>
<p><strong>Gnome.</strong> Gnomes get infravision and are comfortable underground. They’re small but resourceful. Available for: Archeologist, Cave Dweller, Healer, Ranger, Wizard.</p>
<p><strong>Orc.</strong> Orcs get infravision and poison resistance, which is genuinely useful. They tend to have high strength but low charisma. The trade-off is that some shopkeepers are less friendly. Available for: Barbarian, Ranger, Rogue, Wizard.</p>
<h4 id="starting-statistics">Starting Statistics</h4>
<p>Every character gets 75 attribute points distributed across six stats. Your role determines the minimum base values; whatever is left over gets randomly allocated. Barbarians get most of their points locked into Strength and Constitution (as befits someone whose answer to every problem is “hit it harder”). Rogues get almost nothing guaranteed, which means more randomness. Fitting for a class that lives by its wits and luck.</p>

<p>Knights have the highest base sum (69 of 75 points locked in), which means your Knight will feel very similar every time you roll one. A Rogue, by contrast, could come out with surprisingly high Intelligence or surprisingly low everything.</p>

<p>Dwarves excel in Dexterity and Constitution. Elves have the highest Intelligence and Wisdom potential. The human &quot;18/**&quot; means they can reach the full 18/xx Strength range (up to 18/100).</p>
<h4 id="alignment">Alignment</h4>
<p>Your alignment (Lawful, Neutral, or Chaotic) determines which gods you worship, which artifacts you can safely use, and how certain actions affect your standing. It’s tempting to think of these as “good,” “balanced,” and “evil,” but it’s more nuanced than that.</p>
<p>The key thing to understand about alignment is that it’s a number. Every action that matches your alignment’s expectations increases it; actions that violate your alignment’s code decrease it. Your alignment record affects your relationship with your god, which in turn affects whether prayer will save you or smite you.</p>
<p><strong>Lawful</strong> characters should avoid attacking peaceful creatures and should never murder. Sacrifice frequently at co-aligned altars. Lawful has the advantage of access to Excalibur, one of the best weapons in the game, obtainable as early as experience level 5.</p>
<p><strong>Neutral</strong> characters have the most flexibility. You can get away with more than a Lawful character, but your god still frowns on truly chaotic behavior. Neutral has access to some excellent quest artifacts.</p>
<p><strong>Chaotic</strong> characters can kill with relative impunity but should avoid pious behavior that doesn’t match their dark patron’s expectations. Chaotic is often paired with Rogue for thematic consistency.</p>
<p>For your first game: <strong>Lawful Valkyrie, Human or Dwarf.</strong> Strong combat, cold resistance, and the Excalibur path. It’s the closest thing to an easy mode the Mazes offer, which is to say it’s still very hard.</p>

<h3 id="what-to-pack">What to Pack</h3>
<p>Any good travel guide will tell you what to bring. Ours has the awkward job of telling you that you don’t get to choose. Your starting kit is determined by your role, and you’ll descend with whatever your role provides, no more.</p>
<p>What you <em>can</em> choose is what to prioritize once you’re down there. Every role starts with equipment suited to its strengths. The important thing isn’t what’s in your pack on turn one; it’s knowing what to scavenge from the first few levels to shore up your weaknesses.</p>

<p>Items vary by race (Orcs get orcish variants, Elves get elven gear). Wizards have the most random starting items: their spellbook, wand, and ring are all randomly chosen. Knights start with a pony mount, which is both an asset and a liability.</p>
<h4 id="the-early-shopping-list">The Early Shopping List</h4>
<p>No matter your role, here’s what you should be looking for:</p>
<p><strong>A source of nutrition.</strong> You will get hungry. It happens faster than you think. Food rations are the gold standard: 800 nutrition each, they never spoil. Grab every food ration you see. If you’re a role that starts with tripe rations, those are fine for your pet but genuinely unpleasant for you. Eat them only if you must.</p>
<p><strong>A way to identify things.</strong> In the early game, your primary identification tools are altars (drop items to see if they flash blessed/cursed), your pet (it won’t step on cursed items), and experimentation. A scroll of identify is valuable, but you might not find one for a while. A touchstone (a gray stone that identifies gems) is helpful but not urgent.</p>
<p><strong>Armor improvements.</strong> Whatever you’re wearing, you can probably do better. Look for cloaks, helmets, gloves, and boots to fill empty equipment slots. Even basic items like a helmet or pair of gloves provide armor class benefits and can protect against specific attacks.</p>
<p><strong>A ranged attack.</strong> Daggers, darts, or a bow with arrows. Fighting from range is almost always safer than melee, and some monsters (like floating eyes) should never be fought in melee at all.</p>
<p><strong>A light source.</strong> Many areas of the dungeon are dark, and bumbling around blind is a recipe for walking into things you’d rather see coming. An oil lamp or magic lamp is ideal. A candle or two will do in a pinch.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="your-first-descent">Your First Descent</h3>
<p>You step down the stairs. The air is cool and damp. A corridor stretches before you, branching into darkness. Your pet (a little dog or kitten, depending on your inclinations) trots along behind you.</p>
<p>Welcome to the dungeon.</p>
<p>The first few levels of the Mazes are designed to ease you in, which is a relative term. Monsters are weaker, but you are too. Your gear is minimal, your hit points are low, and you don’t yet have the resistances that make the mid-game survivable. More experienced adventurers will tell you that levels one through five are where the most characters die, not because the threats are the greatest, but because you have the fewest resources to deal with them.</p>
<h4 id="the-golden-rules-of-early-survival">The Golden Rules of Early Survival</h4>
<p><strong>Rule 1: Don’t fight what you can’t beat.</strong> This sounds obvious, but it’s the single most violated principle in the Mazes. If a monster is too tough for you, walk away. Use corridors as chokepoints. Funnel enemies so you fight them one at a time. If you stumble into a room full of monsters, step back into the corridor and force them to come to you in single file.</p>
<pre><code>  Bad: fighting in the open        Good: corridor chokepoint

  ┌─────·──────┐                   ┌─────·──────┐
  │·Z··Z·······│                   │·Z···Z······│
  │··Z·@·Z·Z···│                   │··Z··Z······│
  │····Z·······│                   │·Z··········+##@
  │··Z·········│                   │··Z·········│
  └────────────┘                   └────────────┘

  You&#39;re surrounded.               They come to you one at a time.</code></pre>
<p><strong>Rule 2: Don’t eat things you don’t understand.</strong> Monster corpses can grant powerful intrinsics, or they can poison you, give you food poisoning, or worse. Until you know what a corpse does, leave it on the ground. The exceptions: you can always safely eat food rations, lembas wafers, cram rations, and fruits. Lichen corpses are safe and never rot. Lizard corpses are safe, never rot, and cure petrification. Always carry one if you can.</p>
<p><strong>Rule 3: Your pet is your friend.</strong> Your starting pet is more useful than it appears. It will fight alongside you, pick up items (which tells you they’re not cursed, since pets avoid cursed items on the ground), and can even be trained to steal from shops. Keep it fed by dropping tripe rations or corpses near it. A healthy, well-fed pet is one of your best early assets.</p>
<p><strong>Rule 4: Learn to pray.</strong> If you are about to die (hit points critically low, starving, turning to stone) you can pray to your god for help. In the early game, with decent alignment, prayer will almost certainly save you. But you can only pray about once every 300-500 turns, and praying at the wrong time (when your god is angry, when you’re in Gehennom, or when you’ve prayed too recently) can make things much worse. Think of prayer as an emergency button with a cooldown. Don’t waste it on minor problems. We’ll cover the details in <a href="#divine-relations">Divine Relations</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Rule 5: Explore thoroughly but move purposefully.</strong> Every turn you spend in the dungeon costs nutrition. If you stand around for hundreds of turns, you’ll starve. But rushing past rooms means missing items you need. The sweet spot is to explore each level fairly completely (check rooms, open doors, look for hidden passages) but don’t grind. When you’ve found what the level has to offer, move on.</p>
<h4 id="things-that-will-kill-you-and-how-to-avoid-them">Things That Will Kill You (And How to Avoid Them)</h4>
<p>Here’s a short list of common early deaths and how to prevent them:</p>
<p><strong>Starvation.</strong> Eat when you’re Hungry (the status message), not when you’re Weak or Fainting. If you’re Fainting, pray immediately. Pick up every food ration you find.</p>
<p><strong>Floating eyes.</strong> They’re the <code>e</code> on the map. Small, blue, and seemingly harmless. If you hit one in melee, you’ll be paralyzed, and every monster in the vicinity will take free shots at your frozen body. Use ranged attacks, or just walk around them. They don’t pursue you.</p>
<p><strong>Rotted corpses.</strong> If you eat a corpse that’s been on the ground too long, you’ll get food poisoning, which is lethal without treatment. Eat corpses fresh (within a few turns of the kill) or not at all. If you do get food poisoning, pray immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Falling down stairs while overburdened.</strong> If you’re carrying too much, taking the stairs can cause you to tumble and take significant damage. Drop items before descending, or manage your inventory.</p>
<p><strong>Killer bees.</strong> They come in swarms, they’re fast, and in the early game, a group of them can overwhelm you. If you see one bee, expect more. Use a corridor to fight them one at a time.</p>
<p><strong>Your own pet.</strong> If your pet is between you and a narrow corridor, you might accidentally swap places with it repeatedly instead of moving. Worse, if you attack it (because you got confused or forgot it was there), you lose alignment and trust. Be aware of where your pet is.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="role-specific-tips">Role-Specific Tips</h3>
<p>A few notes for specific roles, from travelers who’ve been there before. This is not comprehensive – just the things that aren’t obvious.</p>
<p><strong>Valkyrie.</strong> The recommended first role for a reason. Get Excalibur at level 5 by dipping a long sword in a fountain. Your cold resistance means you can eat things that would freeze other adventurers. In the late game, consider wishing for Grayswandir to complement Excalibur.</p>
<p><strong>Wizard.</strong> You are made of tissue paper for the first ten levels. Lean on Elbereth, your force bolt spell, and your starting cloak of magic resistance (which is <em>incredibly</em> valuable – don’t take it off). Get Magicbane from sacrifice early. Once you have finger of death and magic mapping as spells, you become one of the most powerful roles in the game.</p>
<p><strong>Monk.</strong> Do not wear body armor. Monks get an AC bonus for fighting without it that scales with level, and wearing any non-robe body armor breaks this bonus. Fight with bare hands – your martial arts damage improves with level and eventually surpasses most weapons. Wished-for items: “blessed +3 silver dragon scale mail” is controversial for Monks; many prefer a cloak of magic resistance and to stay armorless. Your quest artifact (Eyes of the Overworld) provides magic resistance.</p>
<p><strong>Samurai.</strong> Your katana is one of the best starting weapons. Keep it. Your skill caps favor katana and long sword. You can’t get Excalibur (wrong alignment), so the Tsurugi of Muramasa from your quest is your endgame weapon.</p>
<p><strong>Tourist.</strong> Yes, it’s designed to be hard. Your darts are actually useful for training ranged combat skills. The camera blinds monsters, which is a genuine tactical tool. Survive to the Castle, wish for equipment, and you’ll be as strong as anyone. The real challenge is getting there.</p>
<p><strong>Healer.</strong> Your stethoscope tells you monster HP, which is incredibly useful for deciding when to fight and when to flee. You start with poison resistance, which prevents many early deaths. Your quest artifact (Staff of Aesculapius) is one of the best in the game: drain life and regeneration.</p>
<p><strong>Rogue.</strong> Stealth from level 1 means many monsters won’t wake up as you walk past them. Your backstab ability makes the first hit in combat significantly stronger. Use daggers as ranged weapons – you get bonuses for throwing them.</p>
<p><strong>Knight.</strong> Your starting pony is powerful early but gets in the way in tight corridors. Feed it and keep it alive; a well-leveled warhorse is devastating. Use your lance from horseback for jousting attacks. Follow the code of conduct: don’t attack fleeing enemies. (Yes, the game tracks this. Yes, it matters.)</p>
<p><strong>Barbarian.</strong> You hit things hard and you can eat almost anything without getting sick, which makes the early food problem largely someone else’s problem. Poison resistance from level 1 is a nice bonus. Your two-handed sword does impressive damage but means no shield – get good AC from other sources. Like the Valkyrie, a straightforward role for players who prefer solving problems by hitting them.</p>
<p><strong>Priestess/Priest.</strong> You start with a mace, holy water, and an uncanny sense for altar alignment. Your healing spells make the early game surprisingly safe. Crowned priests get excellent gifts. The main annoyance: you really want an aligned altar early, and if the dungeon doesn’t cooperate, you’ll feel it.</p>
<p><strong>Ranger.</strong> You’re the ranged combat specialist, and you start with a pile of arrows to prove it. Stay at range whenever possible – your melee skills are mediocre. The quest artifact (Longbow of Diana) is solid but requires reaching the quest alive, which means surviving the awkward period when you run out of arrows. Make more. Buy more. Hoard them like a dragon hoards gold.</p>
<p><strong>Archaeologist.</strong> You start with a pick-axe (instant corridor creation!), a touchstone (gem identification!), and a fedora (style points only). The early game is rough because your combat stats are terrible. Think of yourself as an engineer: dig around problems, identify gems for shop credit, and build up through cleverness rather than brute force.</p>
<p><strong>Cave Dweller.</strong> Your club isn’t glamorous but it works. You start with decent strength and HP, which counts for a lot in the early levels. You can eat almost anything. The quest artifact (Sceptre of Might) provides magic resistance when carried, solving one of the game’s biggest equipment puzzles for you.</p>

<p>The Mazes are procedurally generated. No two visits are quite the same. But the dungeon follows patterns, and understanding those patterns is the first step toward navigating them effectively.</p>
<h4 id="the-big-picture">The Big Picture</h4>
<p>Before we talk about what the symbols mean, here’s the overall shape of the place. The dungeon is a branching tree, and knowing where you are in it helps you plan your route:</p>
<pre><code>  Dungeons of Doom (levels 1-29ish)
    │
    ├── The Gnomish Mines (branch around level 2-4)
    │     ├── Minetown (shops and a temple)
    │     └── Mine&#39;s End (bottom: luckstone)
    │
    ├── Sokoban (branch around level 5-9, goes UP)
    │     └── Top: bag of holding or amulet of reflection
    │
    ├── Your Quest (portal around level 11-16)
    │     └── Unique to your role. Get your quest artifact.
    │
    ├── Fort Ludios (portal, if you find it)
    │     └── A vault full of gold and soldiers
    │
    ├── Medusa&#39;s Island (level ~25)
    │
    └── The Castle (level ~27, bottom of Dungeons of Doom)
          │
  Gehennom (levels 28-50ish)
    │
    ├── Vlad&#39;s Tower (contains the Candelabrum)
    │
    ├── The Wizard&#39;s Tower (Wizard of Yendor, Book of the Dead)
    │
    └── Moloch&#39;s Sanctum (bottom: the Amulet of Yendor)
          │
          (now go ALL the way back up)
          │
          The Elemental Planes
            Earth ─► Air ─► Fire ─► Water
              │
              The Astral Plane (three altars, pick the right one)
                │
                ASCENSION</code></pre>
<p>The typical trip: go down through the Dungeons, detour into the Mines for a luckstone and Minetown’s shops, clear Sokoban for a prize, do your Quest, reach the Castle, descend through Gehennom to get the Amulet, then climb all the way back up and through the Planes. Simple enough on paper. Surviving it is another matter.</p>
<p><strong>Bones files.</strong> Occasionally you’ll encounter a level that feels strangely well-stocked, with a gravestone and a suspiciously well-equipped ghost. This is a bones level – the preserved remains of a previous adventurer who died here. Their gear, their pets (now hostile), and their ghost all persist. Bones levels can be a windfall (free equipment!) or a death trap (whatever killed the last adventurer is still here). Proceed with appropriate caution and respectful looting.</p>

<p>Special rooms never appear on Oracle, Big Room, Rogue, Medusa, or Castle levels. Vaults (isolated 2x2 rooms filled with gold) appear separately with about a 35% chance, sometimes with a portal to Fort Ludios.</p>
<p><strong>Shops</strong> are identified by the shopkeeper standing in the doorway (or inside). Shops sell items of a particular type: general stores (44% of shops), armor shops (14%), scroll shops (10%), potion shops (10%), weapon shops (5%), and rarer specialties like jewelers, wand shops, and rare bookstores. Items on the shop floor belong to the shopkeeper; pick one up and you’ll be quoted a price. You can sell items too. Shopkeepers are extremely powerful in combat, so don’t steal unless you have a plan.</p>
<p><strong>Temples</strong> contain an altar and a priest or priestess. The altar’s alignment matters: if it matches yours, you can sacrifice here, use it for BUC-testing, and chat with the priest to donate gold for divine protection. If it doesn’t match, the resident priest won’t appreciate your attempts to sacrifice.</p>
<p><strong>Zoos</strong> are dangerous early on. All monsters inside are asleep until the door opens, then they all wake at once. Fight from the doorway and pick them off one at a time. The upside: each monster sits on a pile of gold.</p>
<p><strong>Beehives</strong> are filled with killer bees, a queen bee, and lumps of royal jelly. The bees are dangerous in swarms but royal jelly is excellent food. Fight from the corridor.</p>
<p><strong>Barracks</strong> are full of soldiers and sometimes contain treasure chests. Soldiers carry useful equipment (especially in the mid-game) but they’re organized and can overwhelm you.</p>
<p><strong>Graveyards</strong> contain undead and are marked by grave tiles. They tend to appear in the mid-dungeon and are worth exploring for the corpses and chests they contain, but be ready for wraiths (which drain levels) and ghosts (which slow you).</p>
<p><strong>Cockatrice nests</strong> are deadly. The cockatrices inside can turn you to stone with a single touch attack. Always have a lizard corpse or acidic source available before entering one.</p>
<p><strong>Themed rooms</strong> in the current edition add further variety: collections of specific monster types, item caches, and environmental setups. These are too varied to catalog here, but they add welcome diversity to the standard layout.</p>

<p><strong>Dipping in a fountain</strong> is most notable for one thing: if you are Lawful and at least experience level 5, dipping a long sword may transform it into Excalibur, one of the best weapons in the game. Otherwise, dipping can rust metallic items, create hostile water creatures, or occasionally bless the dipped item.</p>
<p>The conventional wisdom is: if you’re a lawful character with a long sword, dip in every fountain you find until you get Excalibur. If you’re not lawful, fountains are mostly a trap. The risks outweigh the benefits.</p>
<h4 id="altars-_">Altars <code>_</code></h4>
<p>Altars are among the most useful features in the dungeon, especially for identification.</p>
<p><strong>Dropping items on an altar</strong> reveals their blessed/cursed/uncursed status: - <strong>Amber flash</strong> → the item is blessed - <strong>Black flash</strong> → the item is cursed - No flash → the item is uncursed</p>
<p>This is the cheapest and most reliable way to check items in the early game. Always clear a path to an altar and ferry suspicious items there for testing.</p>
<p><strong>Sacrificing monster corpses on an altar</strong> builds your relationship with your god. Fresh corpses are required (old ones won’t do). The bigger the monster, the better the sacrifice. Eventually, sufficient sacrifice may summon an artifact weapon aligned to your cause. See <a href="#divine-relations">Divine Relations</a> for full details.</p>
<p><strong>Converting an altar</strong> is possible by offering a same-race corpse of a different alignment on it. This is useful if you find an altar that doesn’t match your alignment.</p>
<h4 id="thrones">Thrones <code>\</code></h4>
<p>Sitting on a throne is a gamble. The possible effects include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A wish (if your luck is positive)</li>
<li>Genocide of a monster class</li>
<li>Free identification of items in your pack</li>
<li>A stat boost or stat drain</li>
<li>An electric shock</li>
<li>Full healing</li>
<li>Summoning a crowd of hostile monsters</li>
<li>Confusion</li>
<li>A curse on one of your items</li>
<li>Magic mapping of the level</li>
<li>Gaining see invisible</li>
<li>Losing all your gold</li>
</ul>
<p>The odds aren’t terrible (about one in six for something to happen at all) but the variance is wild. Sit on a throne when you can afford to deal with the worst outcome.</p>
<h4 id="sinks">Sinks <code>#</code></h4>
<p>Sinks are found in kitchens and have a few uses:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Kicking a sink</strong> can produce a black pudding (dangerous!) or a ring, or just hurt your foot</li>
<li><strong>Quaffing from a sink</strong> can have various minor effects</li>
<li><strong>Dropping a ring down a sink</strong> produces a characteristic message that can help identify the ring type. This is one of the more reliable non-magical identification methods for rings</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="branches-and-landmarks">Branches and Landmarks</h3>
<p>The branch diagram we showed earlier gives the shape of the dungeon, but it doesn’t tell you what to actually do when you arrive. Here’s a more practical tour, in roughly the order you’ll visit these places.</p>
<h4 id="the-gnomish-mines">The Gnomish Mines</h4>
<p>The entrance appears somewhere around dungeon levels 2 through 4, as a downward staircase. You’ll know you’re in the Mines because the walls become rough stone and the corridors get irregular.</p>
<p>The Mines are populated primarily by gnomes, dwarves, and the occasional dwarf lord. If you’re playing a gnomish character, most of them will be peaceful, which makes the Mines a relatively comfortable detour. Everyone else will need to fight through a modest but steady stream of hostile gnomes.</p>
<p><strong>Minetown</strong> appears a few levels into the Mines. It’s a small settlement with shops and a temple, and it’s worth visiting early. The shops let you sell unwanted items for gold and buy useful gear. The temple has an altar (check the alignment) and a resident priest. If the altar matches your alignment, you’ve found a safe place to identify items by dropping them on it.</p>
<p>Watch out for the Minetown watch. The guards are peaceful unless you steal from a shop or attack a peaceful creature. If you anger them, they’ll call for reinforcements.</p>
<p><strong>Mine’s End</strong> is the bottom of the Mines. One of its level variants contains a guaranteed luckstone, which you very much want. A luckstone in your open inventory prevents your luck from timing out toward zero, which affects everything from combat to fountain wishes. Grab it and carry it for the rest of the game.</p>
<h4 id="sokoban">Sokoban</h4>
<p>The entrance appears somewhere around dungeon levels 5 through 9, and it goes up. Sokoban is a set of four puzzle levels where you push boulders onto holes or into place to open a path. No teleport works here, and you can’t dig through the floors.</p>
<p>The puzzles are fixed (two variants per level, randomly chosen). Each level has exactly one correct solution. If you push a boulder into a corner where it blocks your progress, you’re stuck and will need to start the level over. The game won’t warn you about this.</p>
<p>The prize at the top is either a <strong>bag of holding</strong> or an <strong>amulet of reflection</strong>, both extremely valuable. Which one you get depends on the level variant. A bag of holding lets you carry far more inventory at reduced weight. An amulet of reflection bounces ray attacks back at their casters. Either one is worth the detour.</p>
<p>One important rule: the Sokoban levels penalize you for taking the stairs back down. Each time you go down a staircase in Sokoban, you lose one point of luck. Solve each level in one visit if you can. For complete solutions to all eight level variants, see <a href="#sokoban-solutions">Sokoban Solutions</a> in the appendices.</p>
<h4 id="the-quest">The Quest</h4>
<p>Around dungeon levels 11 through 16, you’ll find a magic portal to your Quest. But you can’t enter it immediately. You need to be at least experience level 14, and you need to have spoken to your quest leader (who appears on the first Quest level). The leader sends you to retrieve your role’s quest artifact from a quest nemesis.</p>
<p>Each role has a unique Quest with unique maps, a unique nemesis, and a unique artifact reward. The Valkyrie hunts the Orb of Fate. The Wizard retrieves the Eye of the Aethiopica. The Tourist battles the Master of Thieves for the Platinum Yendorian Express Card. And so on.</p>
<p>Quest artifacts are powerful. Most provide magic resistance, which you absolutely need. Some provide other useful properties like telepathy or warning. Getting your quest artifact is a milestone that marks the transition from “surviving” to “preparing for the endgame.”</p>
<p>If your alignment record is too low (from attacking peacefuls, for instance), your quest leader will refuse to send you. Keep your hands clean.</p>
<h4 id="fort-ludios">Fort Ludios</h4>
<p>Fort Ludios is optional and easy to miss entirely. It appears as a magic portal somewhere in the dungeon, often behind a wall that requires digging to reach. The portal leads to a fortified military compound filled with soldiers, lieutenants, captains, and a whole lot of gold.</p>
<p>The fort is guarded heavily. Soldiers come in numbers, and they carry useful items: C-rations, K-rations, and sometimes decent weapons. The real prize is the gold (thousands of pieces) and the occasional chest. This is a good place to visit if you need money for protection rackets or shop purchases, but it’s not essential for victory.</p>
<p>If you can’t find the portal, don’t worry about it. Fort Ludios is a bonus, not a requirement.</p>
<h4 id="medusas-island">Medusa’s Island</h4>
<p>Medusa’s level sits near the bottom of the Dungeons of Doom, around level 25. You’ll know it by the large body of water and the statues scattered around (those used to be adventurers).</p>
<p>The level has three challenges stacked together:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Crossing the water.</strong> The island is surrounded by water. You’ll need levitation, water walking boots, or some creative approach (freezing water with a wand of cold, building a boulder bridge, polymorphing into a flying creature). Don’t wade in without preparation, because:</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Giant eels.</strong> The water is home to giant eels that can grab and drown you if you’re burdened. Stay unburdened while crossing, or avoid the water entirely.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Medusa herself.</strong> Her gaze turns you to stone. You need either <strong>reflection</strong> (a shield of reflection or amulet of reflection bounces the gaze back, stoning her instead) or <strong>blindness</strong> (you can’t meet her gaze if you can’t see). A mirror also works if you apply it at her. Reflection is the cleanest solution. If you got the amulet of reflection from Sokoban, you’re already prepared.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>There is a downward staircase (or ladder) on the island itself that leads toward the Castle.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Arien Malec’s Medusa Checklist</strong></p>
<p><em>Arien Malec collected crossing strategies from dozens of RGRN posters back in the early 2000s. His original guide remains one of the most consulted single-topic spoilers ever written. Here’s the short version.</em></p>
<p>Before you enter Medusa’s level, confirm you have at least one of the following: (1) an amulet or shield of reflection, (2) a blindfold and some way to detect monsters, or (3) a mirror to apply at her. For crossing the water: levitation is cleanest, water walking boots work, and freezing a path with a wand of cold is reliable. If you have none of these, you can push boulders into the water to build a bridge, though this is slow and leaves you exposed to eels. Whatever you do, stay unburdened. A giant eel grabbing a burdened adventurer in deep water is a drowning, and drowning is an instadeath.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="the-castle">The Castle</h4>
<p>The Castle is the last level of the Dungeons of Doom proper, around level 27. It’s a large fortified structure surrounded by a moat, with a drawbridge as the main entrance. A maze section to the side contains a minotaur.</p>
<p>To enter the Castle, you need to open the drawbridge. Options:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Play the passtune.</strong> A five-note musical sequence played on a tonal instrument (a tooled horn, bugle, or magic harp) opens the drawbridge. The notes are randomized per game. You can learn them by trying different sequences: the game tells you how many notes are correct after each attempt, like a game of Mastermind.</li>
<li><strong>Wand of opening</strong> pointed at the drawbridge.</li>
<li><strong>Spell of knock</strong> cast at the drawbridge.</li>
<li><strong>Wand of striking</strong> on the portcullis.</li>
</ul>
<p>Inside the Castle, you’ll find a throne room, barracks, and several treasure chambers. One of those chambers contains a <strong>wand of wishing</strong>, typically with three charges. This is one of the most important items in the game. Use your wishes wisely (see <a href="#wishes-and-wishing">Wishes and Wishing</a>).</p>
<p>Below the Castle lies Gehennom. There is no going back to the upper dungeon once you descend without climbing back up through everything. Make sure you’re prepared before you go down.</p>
<h4 id="the-oracle">The Oracle</h4>
<p>Somewhere in the mid-levels of the Dungeons of Doom (around levels 5 through 9), you’ll find a special room containing the Oracle of Delphi, flanked by centaur statues and a fountain.</p>
<p>The Oracle offers two services:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Minor consultations</strong> are cheap and produce fortune-cookie-style messages, occasionally useful but mostly atmospheric.</li>
<li><strong>Major consultations</strong> are expensive but provide genuinely helpful gameplay information: hints about monsters, items, and game mechanics.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Oracle is peaceful and never attacks. Her room is a safe place to rest for a moment, though the fountain is subject to the usual fountain risks.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="traps-and-hazards">Traps and Hazards</h3>
<p>The dungeon is littered with traps, represented by <code>^</code> on the map once you’ve discovered them. Traps are invisible until you step on one, detect it with a search, or reveal it by other means. Searching (the <code>s</code> command) in a square adjacent to a trap has a chance of revealing it each time, but the chance is not 100%, so search repeatedly if you suspect traps.</p>
<p>Pets are useful trap detectors. A pet will hesitate to step on a known trap, so watch your pet’s movement for clues.</p>
<p>Here are the traps you’ll encounter, roughly grouped by severity:</p>
<h4 id="nuisance-traps">Nuisance Traps</h4>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">

<tr class="odd">

<td>Rust trap</td>
<td>Splashes water, rusting exposed metal equipment</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Rolling boulder</td>
<td>A boulder rolls at you (dodge or take heavy damage)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>These traps are annoying but rarely lethal on their own. Arrow and dart traps have the small upside of producing ammunition you can collect afterward.</p>
<h4 id="movement-traps">Movement Traps</h4>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">

<tr class="even">

<tr class="odd">

</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Magic portal</td>
<td>Transports to a different branch (branch entrances)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Trapdoors and level teleporters are the most disruptive. They can separate you from your pet and your carefully explored map. If you have teleport control (from an item or intrinsic), teleport traps become convenient transportation instead.</p>
<p>Levitation makes you immune to pit traps and holes.</p>
<h4 id="dangerous-traps">Dangerous Traps</h4>
<table>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Fire traps are the sleeper threat here. A fire trap that ignites when you’re carrying a stack of scrolls of identify or potions of healing can ruin your day. Fire resistance prevents the damage to you but doesn’t protect inventory.</p>
<p>Polymorph traps can be useful if you know what you’re doing (and have polymorph control), but without control, you’ll become something random and possibly unable to use your equipment.</p>
<p>Sleeping gas traps are deadly in areas with monsters, since you’ll be unconscious and unable to fight back while they hit you.</p>
<h4 id="searching-and-detection">Searching and Detection</h4>
<p>The best defense against traps is finding them before they find you.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Search (<code>s</code>)</strong> in place to check adjacent squares. Each search has an independent chance to reveal each adjacent trap, so search multiple times. Your Luck affects the detection chance.</li>
<li><strong>Wand of secret door detection</strong> reveals traps in its path.</li>
<li><strong>Crystal ball</strong> can reveal traps on the level.</li>
<li><strong>Pets</strong> will avoid known traps, giving behavioral clues.</li>
<li><strong>Flying and levitation</strong> make you immune to most floor traps.</li>
</ul>
<p>In corridors where traps are common (especially around dungeon level 5 and below), a quick search before stepping into a new corridor segment can save you from unpleasant surprises.</p>
<h4 id="elbereth">Elbereth</h4>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The mechanics below are drawn from Kate Nepveu’s Elbereth FAQ (2001, updated 2002), one of the clearest single-topic guides in the NetHack community. Kate also maintained steelypips.org, the long-running archive that preserved decades of community spoilers.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Elbereth is not a trap, but it belongs in a chapter about dungeon hazards because it is your best defense against many of them.</p>
<p>Writing the word “Elbereth” on the ground (using the engrave command, <code>E</code>) creates a protective ward. Most monsters will not attack you in melee while you stand on an Elbereth square. This applies whether you wrote it or found it already engraved.</p>
<p>Elbereth has rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It only works while you stand on it.</strong> Step off and the protection ends.</li>
<li><strong>Attacking a monster erases it.</strong> If you fight back, the word smudges and you lose protection. This means Elbereth is defensive only.</li>
<li><strong>Some monsters ignore it.</strong> Anything represented by <code>@</code> (humans, elves, player-like creatures), the Riders on the Astral Plane, Angels, minotaurs, and blind monsters all disregard Elbereth.</li>
<li><strong>Durability varies.</strong> Writing in dust (with your finger) is fast but erases easily. Burning with a wand of fire or lightning is permanent. Engraving with a hard gem or edged weapon falls in between. A dull weapon may not finish all seven letters.</li>
</ul>
<p>The practical use: when things go badly and you need a moment to recover (quaff a healing potion, read a scroll, use an escape item), write Elbereth in the dust and stand on it. Most monsters will back off, giving you a turn to act. It works in most of the dungeon, and it costs nothing.</p>

<h3 id="a-field-guide-to-dungeon-fauna">A Field Guide to Dungeon Fauna</h3>
<p>The Mazes are home to hundreds of monster species, organized into classes denoted by letters. Lowercase letters are generally smaller or less dangerous; uppercase letters are larger or more threatening. Color further distinguishes individual species within a class.</p>
<p>What follows is a class-by-class bestiary. For each monster class we list the symbol, the members you’re likely to care about, and what you need to know to not die. Stats follow this format:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Lev</strong> = hit dice (roughly: hit points and experience). <strong>Spd</strong> = speed (you move at 12; anything faster outruns you). <strong>AC</strong> = armor class (lower = harder to hit). <strong>MR</strong> = magic resistance % (chance to shrug off spells).</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="lowercase-monsters-a-z">Lowercase Monsters (a-z)</h4>
<p><strong><code>a</code> – Ants and Bees.</strong> They come in groups, they’re fast (Spd 18), and soldier ants will ruin your morning. Killer bees are worse: AC -1, Spd 18, and they arrive in swarms of up to eleven. Queen bees (Lev 9, AC -4) are thankfully rare. Fire ants breathe fire, which is rude. All ants are genocidable if you’re fed up.</p>

<p><strong><code>b</code> – Blobs and Cubes.</strong> Slow, blobby, and deceptively dangerous if you melee them without thinking. Acid blobs have a passive acid attack that damages you and your weapon when you hit them. Their corpses convey acid resistance and (unlike most corpses) never rot, making them a useful snack. Gelatinous cubes engulf you, which is as unpleasant as it sounds. Quivering blobs can hold you in place.</p>

<p><strong><code>c</code> – Cockatrices.</strong> The single most important monster class to understand. <strong>Touching a cockatrice or its corpse without gloves turns you to stone.</strong> This includes melee attacks, being hit by one, and picking up the corpse barehanded. However, wielding a cockatrice corpse <em>with gloves</em> gives you one of the most devastating weapons in the game – anything you hit that lacks stoning resistance becomes a statue. The chickatrice is the baby version (equally petrifying). The pyrolisk is the odd one out: it uses a fire gaze instead.</p>

<p><strong><code>d</code> – Dogs and Canines.</strong> Your starting pet is probably here (little dog) or in <code>f</code> (kitten). Dogs level up into large dogs, which are solid combat companions. The wild side of the family includes jackals, wolves, and winter wolves (cold breath, Spd 12). Hell hounds breathe fire and show up in Gehennom. Werecanines revert to human form on death. Winter wolf corpses can grant cold resistance.</p>
<p><strong><code>e</code> – Eyes and Spheres.</strong> <strong>The floating eye is the most important low-level monster in the game.</strong> If you hit one in melee, you are paralyzed, helpless, and every nearby monster gets free attacks on your frozen body. This is responsible for more early deaths than probably anything else. Use ranged attacks, or just walk around them – they have Spd 1 and will not chase you. On the bright side, eating a floating eye corpse grants telepathy, one of the best intrinsics in the game. The spheres (freezing, flaming, shocking) explode when killed, dealing elemental damage in a radius.</p>

<p><strong><code>f</code> – Felines.</strong> The other common starting pet. Kittens grow into housecats and eventually large cats, which are respectable fighters. Wild cats (jaguars, lynxes, panthers, tigers) show up occasionally. None of them are particularly threatening. Feed your pet tripe rations to keep it loyal.</p>
<p><strong><code>g</code> – Gremlins and Gargoyles.</strong> Not gnomes (those are <code>G</code>). Gremlins steal intrinsics at night and in the dark, which is deeply annoying. Stay lit. Gargoyles (AC -4) and winged gargoyles (AC -2, flies) are tough early encounters but have no special tricks beyond being hard to hit.</p>
<p><strong><code>h</code> – Humanoids.</strong> A grab-bag class that includes hobbits, dwarves, and – buried at the bottom of the list like a nasty surprise – <strong>mind flayers</strong>. Dwarves are common in the Mines and usually peaceful to lawful characters. Mind flayers (Lev 9, MR 90) drain your intelligence with each tentacle hit. <strong>If your intelligence reaches zero, you die.</strong> Master mind flayers (Lev 13, MR 90) are even worse. Genocide mind flayers if you can; if you can’t, kill them at range. They also have a psychic blast attack that hits everything nearby.</p>

<p><strong><code>i</code> – Imps and Minor Demons.</strong> Pests. Imps teleport and steal, quasits are fast and annoying, and tengu (Lev 6) teleport constantly. The homunculus can put you to sleep on hit, which is especially dangerous early. Manes and lemures are slow and harmless.</p>
<p><strong><code>j</code> – Jellies.</strong> Stationary (Spd 0) acid monsters. Blue jellies have a passive cold attack. Spotted and ochre jellies have passive acid attacks. Don’t hit them with bare hands or weapons you like. Ranged attacks work fine. Ochre jellies are the most dangerous (Lev 6, engulf attack).</p>
<p><strong><code>k</code> – Kobolds.</strong> The first monster class most characters face. Individually pathetic, but kobold shamans cast spells and some carry poisoned weapons. Ignore them once you’ve outgrown level 3.</p>
<p><strong><code>l</code> – Leprechauns.</strong> Fast (Spd 15), steal your gold on hit, and teleport away. Annoying but not dangerous. If you catch one, it might drop gold. The real problem is when you’re counting on that gold for a shop purchase.</p>
<p><strong><code>m</code> – Mimics.</strong> Disguise themselves as objects (small mimics look like items, giant mimics look like doors or stairs). They hold you when you walk into them. The annoyance is mostly that you waste turns trying to unstick yourself while other monsters attack you.</p>
<p><strong><code>n</code> – Nymphs.</strong> They steal a random item from your inventory and teleport away. This can include your armor, your weapon, your amulet of life saving – anything. Fight them from range. If one does steal something critical, chase it down immediately. All three types (wood, water, mountain) are identical statistically.</p>
<p><strong><code>o</code> – Orcs.</strong> Common in the upper dungeon and especially in the Mines. Goblins, hobgoblins, hill orcs, Uruk-hai – they come in groups and carry weapons. Orc-captains (Lev 5) are the toughest regular variety. Orc shamans cast spells. Usually hostile unless you’re an orc. Not dangerous individually, but a swarm in a corridor can wear you down.</p>
<p><strong><code>p</code> – Piercers.</strong> They cling to ceilings and drop on you. Rock, iron, and glass varieties exist, each tougher than the last. Glass piercers (Lev 7, AC 0) hit hard on the drop but are helpless afterward. More startling than threatening.</p>
<p><strong><code>q</code> – Quadrupeds.</strong> A motley collection of large animals. Rothes are early dungeon livestock. The leocrotta (Spd 18) imitates voices perfectly – it will beg for help while trying to eat you. Trust nothing that talks in the dungeon. Late-game, you might meet a mastodon (Lev 20, Spd 12) – a lot of hit points on four legs. The mumak (Lev 5, AC 0) is a war elephant that hits harder than its level suggests.</p>
<p><strong><code>r</code> – Rodents.</strong> Rats and moles. Sewer rats come in packs, and a rabid rat can give you a disease. Rock moles (AC 0) eat metallic items off the floor, which means they can eat <em>your</em> items if you drop them. Wererats revert to human on death and can infect you with lycanthropy.</p>
<p><strong><code>s</code> – Spiders and Scorpions.</strong> Cave spiders are weak. Giant spiders (Lev 5, Spd 15) are fast and poison. Scorpions also poison and hit harder than you’d expect. All are genocidable.</p>
<p><strong><code>t</code> – Trappers and Lurkers.</strong> The lurker above (Lev 10) and trapper (Lev 12) both disguise themselves as dungeon features and engulf you when you walk over them. They’re slow (Spd 3) and mainly a nuisance – the real danger is being engulfed while other monsters are nearby.</p>
<p><strong><code>u</code> – Unicorns and Horses.</strong> All three unicorn colors (white, gray, black) have the same stats: Lev 4, Spd 24, AC 2, MR 70. The one matching your alignment is peaceful. Throwing gems at a co-aligned unicorn improves your luck (see <a href="#luck-and-fortune">Luck and Fortune</a>). Horses (pony, horse, warhorse) are the Knight’s best friend. A well-fed warhorse (Lev 7, Spd 24) is a formidable combat partner.</p>
<p><strong><code>v</code> – Vortices.</strong> Fast (Spd 20-22) swirling clouds of various elements. Energy vortices are the dangerous one: they drain your magic power and can strip your enchantment. Fire vortices are just hot. All vortices leave no corpse.</p>
<p><strong><code>w</code> – Worms.</strong> Long worms occupy multiple tiles and can grab you from a distance. Purple worms (Lev 15, Spd 9) swallow you whole, which is an engulfing attack that digests you over time. If you die inside one, your possessions are gone too. Kill them from range or be prepared to cut your way out.</p>
<p><strong><code>x</code> – Grid Bugs and Xans.</strong> Grid bugs (Lev 0) are trivial – they can only move in four cardinal directions. Xans (Lev 7, AC -4) prick your legs, reducing your movement speed. Annoying but rarely fatal.</p>
<p><strong><code>y</code> – Lights.</strong> Yellow lights blind you on explosion. Black lights blind you and also hallucinate. Neither has a corpse. They’re fast (Spd 15) and exist mainly to ruin your situational awareness at inconvenient moments.</p>
<p><strong><code>z</code> – Zruty.</strong> A single species, Lev 9, Spd 8, AC 3. Nothing special about it. The zruty exists mostly so that <code>z</code> has something in it.</p>
<h4 id="uppercase-monsters-a-z">Uppercase Monsters (A-Z)</h4>
<p><strong><code>A</code> – Angels and Celestials.</strong> Powerful aligned beings. An angel matching your alignment is peaceful; attacking it is a terrible idea (alignment penalty, and they hit back hard). Archons (Lev 19, Spd 16, AC -6, MR 80) are among the toughest non-unique monsters. Ki-rin (Lev 16, MR 90) are similarly nasty. You’ll mostly encounter these on the Astral Plane.</p>

<p><strong><code>B</code> – Bats.</strong> Fast (Spd 22) but weak. They move erratically, which makes them annoying to fight in corridors. Vampire bats drain levels and are the only ones to take seriously. Giant bats are just big bats.</p>
<p><strong><code>C</code> – Centaurs.</strong> Plains, forest, and mountain varieties, each faster and tougher than the last. Mountain centaurs (Lev 6, Spd 20) are good archers and carry bows. They hit reasonably hard in melee too. Not a major threat by mid-game, but they can soften you up at range before you close the distance.</p>
<p><strong><code>D</code> – Dragons.</strong> Every color has a different breath weapon and a corresponding resistance. Dragon scale mail is the best body armor in the game. Gray dragons (magic resistance) and silver dragons (reflection) are the most sought-after. Baby dragons are still tough (Lev 12, AC 2). Adults are serious opponents (Lev 15, AC -1, MR 20). Eating a dragon corpse grants its color’s resistance. See <a href="#the-armory">The Armory</a> for the full dragon scale mail table.</p>

<p><strong><code>E</code> – Elementals.</strong> Four classical types plus the stalker (invisible, nasty). Air elementals (Spd 36!) engulf you; earth elementals phase through walls; fire and water elementals are straightforward melee bruisers. They leave no corpse. You’ll encounter them mostly on the Elemental Planes, where they come in overwhelming numbers.</p>
<p><strong><code>F</code> – Fungi and Molds.</strong> Mostly stationary. Brown, yellow, green, and red molds all have passive attacks when you hit them in melee (cold, poison, acid, fire respectively). <strong>Shriekers</strong> don’t attack at all – they just scream and summon every monster in the vicinity, which is often worse. Violet fungi stick to you. Lichens are safe to eat (they’re vegan!) and never rot.</p>
<p><strong><code>G</code> – Gnomes.</strong> Common in the Gnomish Mines. Gnomes, gnome lords, gnomish wizards, gnome kings – a hierarchy of small bearded people. Usually peaceful if you’re a gnome. Gnomish wizards (Lev 3, MR 10) cast spells and can be annoying. Gnome kings carry wands sometimes.</p>
<p><strong><code>H</code> – Giants and Huge Humanoids.</strong> Giants throw boulders, hit hard in melee, and carry gems. Each type is aligned with an element: stone giants, hill giants, fire giants (fire resistance from corpse), frost giants (cold resistance from corpse), and storm giants (shock resistance from corpse). The titan (Lev 16, Spd 18, AC -3, MR 70) is the king of this class. Ettins have two heads and two attacks per round. Minotaurs show up in mazes and always know where they’re going.</p>

<!-- Stalkers are class E internally, but display as I on screen -->
<p><strong><code>I</code> – Invisible Creatures.</strong> When the game wants to hint that something invisible is nearby, it shows the <code>I</code> glyph. This covers stalkers and other unseen threats. If you see a blank space attacking you, use telepathy or see invisible to fight back.</p>
<p><strong><code>J</code> – Jabberwock.</strong> A single species (Lev 15, Spd 12, AC -2, MR 50). Big, mean, and hits multiple times per round. Nothing special beyond being a solid mid-game challenge. It exists because Lewis Carroll exists.</p>
<p><strong><code>K</code> – Keystone Kops.</strong> They show up if you rob a shop and flee. Individually weak but they come in groups with the shopkeeper, who is much more dangerous. Don’t rob shops unless you can handle the consequences.</p>
<p><strong><code>L</code> – Liches.</strong> Spellcasters that get worse at every tier. Regular liches (Lev 11) are manageable. Demiliches (Lev 14) are a step up. Master liches (Lev 17, MR 90) cast dangerous spells including summon nasties. <strong>Arch-liches (Lev 25, AC -6, MR 90)</strong> are among the most dangerous monsters in the game – they cast from a devastating spell list, teleport, and regenerate. Genocide them if you can spare the scroll.</p>

<p><strong><code>M</code> – Mummies.</strong> Undead with a grab attack. Each race has a mummy variant (kobold mummy through giant mummy). They’re slow and their main threat is experience drain on hit. Their wrappings are not useful armor. Mummy corpses are ancient and will give you food poisoning if you eat them.</p>
<p><strong><code>N</code> – Nagas.</strong> Serpentine creatures in four flavors. Red nagas spit fire. Black nagas spit acid and their corpse grants poison resistance. Golden nagas (Lev 10, MR 70) are spell-resistant. Guardian nagas (Lev 12, Spd 16) spit poison and are genuinely tough. Not to be confused with nymphs (<code>n</code>), despite the capital letter.</p>

<p><strong><code>O</code> – Ogres.</strong> Strong, dumb, and numerous. Ogres (Lev 5), ogre lords (Lev 7), and ogre kings (Lev 9) form a simple hierarchy. They hit hard in melee and carry gold. Not interesting, just strong. They show up frequently in the mid-dungeon.</p>
<p><strong><code>P</code> – Puddings and Oozes.</strong> Gray ooze rusts metal. Brown puddings corrode metal. <strong>Black puddings (Lev 10)</strong> split in two when hit with iron weapons, potentially multiplying until the room is full of them. Use non-metallic weapons (whip, mattock) or ranged attacks. <strong>Green slime</strong> is the really dangerous one: its attack starts turning you into slime. Burn or prayer cures it, but you have very few turns.</p>
<p><strong><code>Q</code> – Quantum Mechanics.</strong> Yes, really. A single species (Lev 7, Spd 12). They speed you up or slow you down on hit, and they sometimes teleport you. Appropriately unpredictable.</p>
<p><strong><code>R</code> – Rust Monsters and Disenchanters.</strong> Rust monsters (Lev 5) corrode your iron equipment on contact. Disenchanters (Lev 12) remove enchantment from your gear. Both are non-threatening in combat but can wreck your equipment in seconds. Fight them with non-metallic weapons or at range. Elven gear is immune to rust.</p>
<p><strong><code>S</code> – Snakes.</strong> Garter snakes are harmless. Everything else poisons: cobras, pit vipers, asps. <strong>Water moccasins</strong> come from dipping things in fountains and from Medusa’s level. Python (Lev 6) constricts. Nothing here is a serious late-game threat but early poison can be lethal without resistance.</p>
<p><strong><code>T</code> – Trolls.</strong> They regenerate, and they come back from the dead. Kill a troll and its corpse will reanimate a few turns later unless you eat it, tin it, or carry it away. This is more annoying than dangerous once you know about it. The olog-hai (Lev 13, AC -4) is the toughest variety. Ice trolls are cold-resistant. Water trolls show up swimming.</p>

<p><strong><code>U</code> – Umber Hulk.</strong> A single species (Lev 9, Spd 6, AC 2). <strong>Confuses you on sight</strong>, which is its main danger. If confused, you move randomly and might walk into lava or attack your pet. Use a blindfold to fight it safely, or just kill it fast from a corridor.</p>
<p><strong><code>V</code> – Vampires.</strong> Level-draining undead. Vampire lords (Lev 12, Spd 14) fly and are fast. Vlad the Impaler (Lev 14, Spd 18, AC -3, MR 80) guards his tower and the Candelabrum of Invocation. Vampires shapeshift into bats and fog clouds, which makes them hard to pin down. Undead turning works. Corpses are not useful (and may not appear).</p>
<p><strong><code>W</code> – Wraiths and Wights.</strong> Wraiths drain your experience level on hit – but eating a wraith corpse <em>grants</em> a level, making them one of the few monsters you actually want to find. Eat the corpse immediately (they rot fast). Barrow wights are early undead pests. Nazgul (Lev 13, MR 25) are dangerous late-game encounters that drain levels and cast spells.</p>
<p><strong><code>X</code> – Xorn.</strong> A single species (Lev 8, Spd 9, AC -2, MR 20). Xorns phase through walls and eat metal items off the ground (and sometimes from your inventory). They’re tough for when you first encounter them but not a major threat.</p>
<p><strong><code>Y</code> – Apelike Creatures.</strong> Yetis, carnivorous apes, sasquatch. Yetis (Lev 5) have cold resistance and their corpses can grant it. The sasquatch (Lev 7) is strong but uncommon. Nothing here is particularly scary.</p>
<p><strong><code>Z</code> – Zombies and Skeletons.</strong> Slow, numerous, and undead. Every race has a zombie variant. Their corpses are always old (they were dead already) and will poison you if eaten. Skeletons are tougher than zombies of the same race. Giant zombies and skeleton warriors can be a nuisance in numbers. Undead turning clears them out.</p>
<h4 id="special-symbol-monsters">Special Symbol Monsters</h4>
<p><strong><code>@</code> – Humans and Player-Types.</strong> This class includes shopkeepers, guards, aligned priests, the Oracle, Medusa, Croesus, and the Wizard of Yendor. Shopkeepers (Lev 12, Spd 18, MR 50) are fast and hit hard – never anger one unless you can take the heat. The <strong>Wizard of Yendor</strong> (Lev 30, Spd 12, AC -8, MR 100) is the game’s signature nemesis: he harasses you repeatedly after you steal the Amulet, summoning nasties and stealing the Amulet back if he can.</p>

<p><strong><code>&amp;</code> – Demons.</strong> The heavyweights. Minor demons (water demons, succubi, incubi) are manageable. Major demons are boss-tier. Orcus carries a wand of death. Demogorgon (Lev 106!) is the single toughest monster in the game – disease attacks, spellcasting, and more hit points than you can easily comprehend. The three Riders (Death, Pestilence, Famine) guard the Astral Plane and cannot be permanently killed.</p>

<p><strong><code>;</code> – Sea Monsters.</strong> Eels, krakens, sharks, and piranhas. <strong>Drowning is an instadeath</strong> – giant eels and krakens can grab you and pull you under if you’re too encumbered to escape. Stay unburdened near water. An amulet of magical breathing or levitation prevents drowning. Electric eels shock you. The kraken (Lev 20) is the king of the deep.</p>
<p><strong><code>:</code> – Reptiles and Lizards.</strong> Newts are the first monster most characters ever see. Lizards (Lev 5) are strategically critical: <strong>lizard corpses cure petrification in progress and never rot.</strong> Always carry one. Always. Chameleons (Lev 6) polymorph into random monsters, which can be nasty or trivial depending on luck. Crocodiles (Lev 6, Spd 9) and salamanders (Lev 8, AC -1) are the combat threats.</p>
<p><strong><code>&#39;</code> – Golems.</strong> Constructed creatures in various materials. They range from straw golems (Lev 3, pathetic) to iron golems (Lev 18, MR 60, scary). Each drops its material when destroyed: paper golems drop scrolls, clay golems drop rocks, iron golems drop iron chains. Flesh golems (Lev 9, MR 30) have a useful property: their corpse grants shock and fire resistance.</p>

<p>The three rules that will save your life more than anything in this bestiary: <strong>never melee a floating eye, always carry a lizard corpse, and respect anything with <code>D</code> or <code>&amp;</code> on your screen.</strong></p>
<hr />
<h3 id="dangerous-encounters">Dangerous Encounters</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The catalog of instadeaths below is informed by Trevor Powell’s Instadeath Spoiler, compiled from RGRN posts and Dylan O’Donnell’s spoiler files around 2001. Trevor defined an instadeath as “a single move death which does not involve the player’s hit points dropping to zero,” and his taxonomy has been the standard reference ever since.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some things in the Mazes kill you outright. Not by whittling down your hit points, not by wearing you down over time, but by ending your life in a single move with no second chance. These are called instadeaths, and learning to recognize the situations that produce them is the difference between a promising run and a one-line epitaph.</p>
<h4 id="petrification-stoning">Petrification (Stoning)</h4>
<p>Anything involving cockatrices or Medusa. Touching a cockatrice without gloves, eating a cockatrice corpse, being hit by Medusa’s gaze, or even stepping on a cockatrice corpse while barefoot will turn you to stone. The process can be immediate or delayed (you’ll see the message “You are slowing down” with a few turns to act).</p>
<p><strong>Defenses:</strong> Wear gloves when handling cockatrice corpses. Carry a lizard corpse at all times (eating it cures stoning in progress). Use reflection against Medusa. Stoning resistance (from eating an acid blob or certain other sources) makes you immune.</p>
<p><strong>The other side of the coin:</strong> a wielded cockatrice corpse (with gloves on) is one of the most devastating weapons in the game. Anything you hit with it that lacks stoning resistance turns to stone.</p>
<h4 id="drowning">Drowning</h4>
<p>Giant eels and krakens can grab you and pull you underwater. If you’re burdened or worse when grabbed, you can drown before you get a turn to respond. This happens most often at Medusa’s level and in the endgame.</p>
<p><strong>Defenses:</strong> Stay unburdened near water. An amulet of magical breathing lets you survive underwater. Levitation keeps you above the water entirely. Kill sea monsters at range whenever possible.</p>
<h4 id="the-touch-of-death">The Touch of Death</h4>
<p>Some monsters, most notably Death (one of the Riders on the Astral Plane), can kill you with a single touch. The Finger of Death spell and the wand of death work similarly.</p>
<p><strong>Defenses:</strong> Magic resistance blocks the touch of death and the wand/spell. It does not block Death himself (the Rider), who is a special case. An amulet of life saving will revive you once.</p>
<h4 id="starvation">Starvation</h4>
<p>This isn’t technically instant, but it feels like it. If your nutrition drops to zero, you faint. If you don’t eat something while fainted, you die. In the early game before you’ve established a food supply, starvation is a real threat.</p>
<p><strong>Defenses:</strong> Eat corpses promptly. Pray when your god is willing and you are Weak or Fainting (prayer cures hunger). Carry food rations, tripe rations, or lembas wafers. Don’t let nutrition management slide.</p>
<h4 id="brainlessness">Brainlessness</h4>
<p>Mind flayers drain Intelligence with their tentacle attacks. If your Intelligence reaches zero, you die instantly. In current editions, mind flayers no longer cause amnesia, but the Intelligence drain is still lethal if unchecked.</p>
<p><strong>Defenses:</strong> Wear a greased helmet to prevent tentacle attacks from connecting. Kill mind flayers at range (wands, spells). Use a unicorn horn or other means to restore lost Intelligence before it reaches critical levels.</p>
<h4 id="choking">Choking</h4>
<p>If you eat while already satiated, you can choke and die. The game warns you (“You’re having a hard time getting all of it down”), but if you confirm, you’re dead.</p>
<p><strong>Defense:</strong> Don’t eat when satiated. Just don’t.</p>
<h4 id="deadly-poison">Deadly Poison</h4>
<p>A handful of monsters (pit vipers, some spiders) have instantly lethal poison attacks. The chance is low but nonzero. Eating certain corpses (Death, Pestilence) is also instantly fatal poison.</p>
<p><strong>Defenses:</strong> Poison resistance makes you immune. Most characters can get this early by eating enough appropriate corpses. It’s one of the first intrinsics worth acquiring.</p>
<h4 id="disintegration">Disintegration</h4>
<p>A black dragon’s breath weapon disintegrates you. Touching a wide-angle disintegration beam also kills.</p>
<p><strong>Defenses:</strong> Disintegration resistance (from eating a black dragon corpse or wearing black dragon scale mail). Reflection bounces the beam back. Magic resistance does NOT protect against disintegration.</p>
<h4 id="genocide">Genocide</h4>
<p>Reading a scroll of genocide lets you remove an entire species from the game. Blessed genocide removes a class (letter), uncursed removes a species. Confused genocide genocides your own race. Don’t do this.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended genocide targets</strong> (roughly in priority order):</p>

<p>A few notes: <code>L</code> as a class genocide gets all liches (regular, demilich, master lich, arch-lich) in one go – extremely efficient. The <code>;</code> class also removes kraken and other sea creatures. Class <code>h</code> covers mind flayers, minotaurs, and other medium humanoids, so it’s a broader sweep. Choose based on what’s killing you.</p>
<h4 id="the-amulet-of-life-saving">The Amulet of Life Saving</h4>
<p>This deserves special mention. An amulet of life saving, when worn, revives you once from any death (including instadeaths). The amulet is consumed in the process. If you find one, save it for the endgame or for situations where instadeath risk is high. It’s your insurance policy.</p>

<p>The short version: you need <strong>magic resistance</strong>, <strong>reflection</strong>, <strong>poison resistance</strong>, and a <strong>lizard corpse</strong> to survive the dungeon’s worst surprises. Get these as early as you can. Everything else is luxury. These are survival.</p>

<p>DSM = dragon scale mail. Eating a dragon corpse always conveys its color’s resistance. Rings of resistance are the backup plan when you can’t get DSM. Magic resistance and reflection have no corpse sources – you need equipment for these.</p>

<p>Most deaths in NetHack fall into one of these categories. The common thread: the defense existed, you just didn’t have it yet. That’s the game in a nutshell.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="making-friends">Making Friends</h3>
<p>Not everything in the Mazes wants to kill you. Some creatures can be tamed, and a tame creature is one of the most useful assets you can have.</p>
<h4 id="starting-pets">Starting Pets</h4>
<p>Most roles begin the game with a pet: either a little dog or a kitten, depending on your role. Your starting pet is loyal, follows you between levels (if adjacent when you take stairs), and will fight on your behalf. It will also pick up items and eat food it finds.</p>
<p>A pet that eats enough and fights enough will grow. A little dog becomes a dog, then a large dog. A kitten becomes a housecat, then a large cat. Grown pets are substantially more dangerous in combat.</p>
<p>Your pet will not step on cursed items willingly. This is one of the cheapest ways to detect cursed items in the early game: drop items on the ground and see if your pet avoids them.</p>
<h4 id="feeding-and-loyalty">Feeding and Loyalty</h4>
<p>Pets have a tameness score that decreases over time and when they take damage. If tameness reaches zero, the pet goes feral. Feeding your pet keeps tameness high:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dogs</strong> eat tripe rations and most meat.</li>
<li><strong>Cats</strong> eat tripe rations and most meat.</li>
<li><strong>Horses</strong> eat apples, carrots, and other vegetarian food.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tripe rations are ideal for dogs and cats. You’ll find them scattered through the dungeon. When you see one, pick it up even if you don’t want to eat it yourself (it’s terrible food for humans, but pets love it).</p>
<p>If your pet dies, you can tame a new creature. The most common method is throwing appropriate food at a suitable animal.</p>
<h4 id="taming-new-creatures">Taming New Creatures</h4>
<p>Several methods work:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Throwing food</strong> at a creature appropriate to its diet. Dogs and cats take tripe, meat, and other food. Horses take vegetarian food.</li>
<li><strong>Scroll of taming</strong> tames creatures in a radius around you.</li>
<li><strong>Spell of charm monster</strong> tames a single adjacent creature.</li>
<li><strong>Magic trap effects</strong> occasionally produce taming.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can tame most creatures this way, including powerful ones. A tame purple worm, dragon, or titan is a formidable ally. The main exceptions are unique monsters (Medusa, the Wizard) and certain special creatures that resist taming.</p>
<h4 id="what-pets-do-for-you">What Pets Do for You</h4>
<p>A well-maintained pet provides several services:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Combat.</strong> Pets attack hostile monsters on your behalf. A strong pet can clear rooms for you.</li>
<li><strong>Cursed item detection.</strong> Pets refuse to step on cursed items, which is a free and reliable test.</li>
<li><strong>Stealing from shops.</strong> If your pet picks up an item in a shop and carries it outside, you haven’t technically stolen it. This is the cheapest way to acquire expensive shop items. It takes patience (the pet must wander onto the item and then wander out the door) but costs nothing.</li>
<li><strong>Sacrifice fodder.</strong> When a pet kills a monster, the corpse can be sacrificed on an altar just as if you’d killed it yourself.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="keeping-your-pet-alive">Keeping Your Pet Alive</h4>
<p>Pets can die from the same things that kill you: traps, poison, powerful monsters. They can also drown if they follow you across water. Keep an eye on your pet’s health (use the farlook command, <code>;</code>, to check) and avoid leading it into danger it can’t handle.</p>
<p>If you change levels and your pet isn’t adjacent, it won’t follow you. You’ll see the message “You have a sad feeling for a moment.” Your pet is still alive on the level you left, but it will lose tameness while separated from you. Come back for it before it goes feral.</p>

<h2 id="part-four-gear-and-provisions">Part Four: Gear and Provisions</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Much of the item data in Part Four has been verified against Kevin Hugo and Dylan O’Donnell’s comprehensive 3.4.3 spoiler files, updated where the current edition of the game has changed. Identification methods owe a debt to David Damerell’s Object Identification FAQ and Kieron Dunbar’s wand ID guide, both cornerstones of the RGRN community spoiler tradition.</em></p>

<hr />
<h3 id="the-identification-problem">The Identification Problem</h3>
<p>Here is the central puzzle of the Mazes, and the thing that kills more promising expeditions than any monster: you will find dozens of items, and you won’t know what most of them are.</p>
<p>That potion might heal you or it might make you hallucinate. That scroll could enchant your armor or destroy it. That ring could grant you invisibility or slowly starve you to death. In the Mazes, ignorance is not bliss. Ignorance is death by unidentified wand.</p>
<p>Every game, the dungeon shuffles the deck. Potions, scrolls, wands, rings, amulets, and spellbooks are all given randomized appearances. The “milky potion” in this game might be healing; in your next game it might be paralysis. The only things that stay consistent between games are the item classes themselves (a <code>!</code> is always a potion, a <code>?</code> is always a scroll) and the prices, which turn out to be the single most powerful identification tool you have.</p>
<h4 id="blessed-uncursed-cursed">Blessed, Uncursed, Cursed</h4>
<p>Before you can worry about <em>what</em> an item is, you need to know <em>what condition</em> it’s in. Every item in the Mazes is blessed, uncursed, or cursed (BUC for short). This affects how the item behaves, often dramatically:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>blessed</strong> scroll of identify will reveal all items in your pack. A cursed one identifies only a single item.</li>
<li>A <strong>cursed</strong> piece of armor cannot be removed once worn.</li>
<li>A <strong>cursed</strong> potion of gain level sends you up through the ceiling to the level above instead of granting an experience level.</li>
</ul>
<p>You don’t see BUC status by default (Priests are the exception; they sense it naturally). But there are several reliable ways to check:</p>
<p><strong>Altar testing.</strong> Drop an item on an altar. An amber flash means blessed. A black flash means cursed. No flash means uncursed. This is free, fast, and unlimited. If you find an altar early, use it heavily.</p>
<p><strong>Pet testing.</strong> Your pet won’t step on cursed items. If you drop something and your dog walks around it, it’s cursed. If the dog walks over it (or picks it up), it’s safe. Not as precise as an altar, but works anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Holy water.</strong> Dipping an item in blessed water (holy water) will uncurse or bless it. Dipping in cursed water (unholy water) will curse it. Holy water is precious in the early game, so save it for items you’ve already identified.</p>
<p><strong>Scroll of identify.</strong> A blessed scroll of identify will identify everything in your pack at once. This is the gold standard, but you need to identify the scroll first (irony noted) and bless it.</p>
<h4 id="the-price-is-right">The Price Is Right</h4>
<p>Shopkeepers are, without exaggeration, your most important identification tool. Every unidentified item has a fixed base price that depends on what it actually is. When you pick up an item in a shop, the shopkeeper quotes you a price derived from that base price, modified by your Charisma and the shopkeeper’s markup.</p>
<p>The key insight: items in the same category that share a base price are in the same <strong>price group</strong>. If you know the price, you can narrow down the possibilities enormously, sometimes to just two or three candidates.</p>
<p>Here’s how to do it. Pick up an item in a shop and note the price quoted. The quote will be higher than base price (shopkeepers mark up). With average Charisma, the sell price is typically one third of base and the buy price is roughly double. You don’t need to memorize exact formulas. What matters is grouping: items quoted at similar prices are in the same price tier.</p>
<p>The price tables for each item class follow. These are your field reference for shopping trips.</p>
<h5 id="scroll-prices">Scroll Prices</h5>
<table>
<colgroup>

</table>
<p>The $100 group is crowded, which makes scroll price-ID less precise than other categories. But you can still narrow things down. If a scroll is in the $20 group, it’s identify. Period. That’s one of the most useful scrolls in the game and you just found it for free.</p>

<p>Water is always the “clear” potion, so if you see “clear potion” you know what it is without even checking the price. Healing sits alone at $20 – a lucky break for price identification. The $50 group is tricky because sickness and see invisible are in there together (one very good, one very bad). The $200 group is packed with excellent potions.</p>

<p>If a wand costs $500, you are having a very good day.</p>
<h5 id="amulet-prices">Amulet Prices</h5>
<p>All amulets have a base price of $150 except the cheap Amulet of Yendor imitations ($0). Price doesn’t help here. You’ll need to rely on other methods.</p>
<h4 id="the-engrave-test-wands">The Engrave Test (Wands)</h4>
<p>This is the single most useful trick for wand identification and costs you nothing. Apply a wand by engraving on the floor with it (command: <code>E</code>, then select the wand). What happens tells you what the wand is:</p>
<pre><code>  What you see when you engrave:          Wand type
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  &quot;A lit field surrounds you&quot;             light
  Your engraving vanishes                 cancellation/make invisible
  &quot;Bugs appear in the engraving&quot;          create monster  (no bugs)
  You feel self-knowledgeable             enlightenment
  &quot;The engraving in the floor is gone&quot;    polymorph/teleportation
  Your engraving is smudged               secret door detection  (no)
  The floor is riddled by holes           digging
  The bugs on the floor stop moving       sleep
  Lightning strikes the engraving         lightning
  The engraving is covered in frost       cold
  The engraving catches fire              fire
  Nothing happens (but a charge is used)  nothing
  You write in the dust                   all BEAM wands (1 charge used)</code></pre>
<p>The engrave test costs one charge per wand but preserves the rest. With one zap you can sort most wands into clear categories. For BEAM wands (which just write in the dust like a finger), you’ll need further testing: try zapping them at a monster or in a safe direction.</p>
<p>Crucially, engraving with a wand of wishing does nothing special. It just uses a charge. So if you suspect you have a wand of wishing ($500 price), do NOT engrave with it. Zap it directly.</p>
<h4 id="the-sink-test-rings">The Sink Test (Rings)</h4>
<p>If you find a sink (usually in a kitchen), you can drop a ring down it. Each ring type produces a characteristic message:</p>
<pre><code>  Message you hear or see:                Ring type
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  &quot;The water flow seems fixed&quot;            sustain ability
  &quot;The water flow seems stronger/weaker&quot;  gain constitution/gain strength
  &quot;The sink quivers upward&quot;               levitation
  &quot;You smell rotten &lt;fruit&gt;&quot;              poison resistance
  &quot;Several flies buzz angrily&quot;            protection from shape changers
  &quot;Static electricity surrounds the sink&quot; shock resistance
  &quot;The water flow seems lesser/greater&quot;   increase damage/increase accuracy
  &quot;The cold water faucet flashes brightly&quot; fire resistance
  &quot;The hot water faucet flashes brightly&quot; cold resistance
  &quot;The sink seems to blend into the floor&quot; stealth
  &quot;You don&#39;t see anything happen&quot;         invisibility (but the sink vanished!)
  &quot;You thought your ring got lost...&quot;     searching
  &quot;You hear a loud grinding sound&quot;        aggravate monster
  &quot;The sink glows silver&quot;                 free action
  &quot;The water flow hits the bottom&quot;        hunger
  &quot;You see the ring slide right down&quot;     slow digestion (never lost in sink)
  &quot;The sink looks as good as new&quot;         regeneration
  &quot;You see a ring shining in its center&quot;  adornment
  &quot;The faucets flash from the water&quot;      warning
  &quot;The sink momentarily vanishes&quot;         teleportation
  &quot;The sink looks nothing like a deck&quot;    polymorph (it briefly changes)
  &quot;The sink starts running like crazy&quot;    conflict
  &quot;You hear a strange wind&quot;              teleport control
  &quot;The sink seemingly makes no change&quot;    polymorph control
  &quot;The ring is regurgitated&quot;              protection</code></pre>
<p>You have about a 95% chance of losing the ring each time, so only test rings you’re willing to sacrifice. The two exceptions: searching and slow digestion rings are never lost.</p>
<h4 id="use-testing-the-careful-way">Use-Testing (The Careful Way)</h4>
<p>When you don’t have access to a shop or a sink, you can sometimes figure out what an item is by using it carefully. Here’s the approach for each category:</p>
<p><strong>Potions.</strong> The safest test is to throw a potion at a monster and observe the effect. Throwing avoids the risk of drinking something lethal. If a potion heals the monster, it’s some kind of healing potion. If the monster speeds up, it’s speed. If the monster becomes invisible, well, you’ve learned something (and now have an invisible monster to deal with).</p>
<p>You can also dip items into potions. Dipping a weapon into a potion of sickness will poison it, confirming the potion’s identity. Dipping a unicorn horn into a potion of confusion, hallucination, or sickness will turn it into water.</p>
<p><strong>Scrolls.</strong> Reading is risky. Some scrolls (destroy armor, amnesia, punishment) are genuinely harmful. The safest approach is to price-ID first, then read scrolls from safe price groups. If you must test blind: take off your armor before reading a scroll that might be destroy armor. Read from a position where teleportation won’t be disastrous.</p>
<p>Confused reading produces different effects for many scrolls and is sometimes useful. A confused scroll of remove curse, for example, will <em>curse</em> items instead.</p>
<p><strong>Rings.</strong> First, confirm the ring is not cursed (altar or pet test). Then put it on. Many rings produce an immediate message or visible effect: you start levitating, you become invisible, you feel stronger. If nothing obvious happens, check your stats and inventory for subtle changes (protection, searching). Take it off quickly if you start feeling hungry faster than normal (hunger ring) or if monsters seem to be approaching more aggressively (aggravate monster).</p>
<p><strong>Amulets.</strong> Most amulets are safe to wear briefly. Put it on, wait a few turns, take it off. The dangerous ones (strangulation, restful sleep) are usually cursed, so check BUC first. An amulet of ESP reveals itself if you go blind while wearing it (you’ll see monsters as brain-shapes). Amulet of reflection is trickier to detect, but you’ll notice it when a ray bounces off you.</p>
<p><strong>Armor.</strong> Try it on (after checking it’s not cursed). Magical armor reveals itself immediately: speed boots make you faster, a cloak of invisibility makes you invisible. Mundane armor is identifiable by its appearance (the “old gloves” are leather gloves, “riding boots” are fumble boots, and so on).</p>
<p>Here’s a useful table of boot and helmet appearances:</p>
<pre><code>  Appearance:          Possible identities:
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  mud boots            elven boots (stealth)
  buckled boots        kicking boots
  riding boots         fumble boots (often cursed!)
  snow boots           levitation boots (often cursed!)
  hiking boots         jumping boots
  combat boots         speed boots
  jungle boots         water walking boots

  conical hat          dunce cap OR cornuthaum
  plumed helmet        regular helmet
  etched helmet        helm of brilliance
  crested helmet       helm of opposite alignment
  visored helmet       helm of telepathy</code></pre>
<h4 id="naming-what-youve-learned">Naming What You’ve Learned</h4>
<p>As you gather clues, use the <code>#name</code> command (or <code>N</code>) to track what you know. You can <strong>call</strong> an entire item class by a name you choose. For example, if you’ve determined that “fizzy potions” are in the $200 price group, call them “fizzy=$200” so you don’t forget. If you later throw one at a monster and it speeds up, you can rename the class to “speed.”</p>
<p>This habit of annotating your discoveries is what separates adventurers who die on level 8 from adventurers who reach the Castle. The dungeon doesn’t keep notes for you. You have to do it yourself.</p>
<h4 id="a-practical-strategy">A Practical Strategy</h4>
<p>All of these techniques combine into a workflow. Here’s what a seasoned traveler does on a typical descent:</p>
<p><strong>At an altar</strong> (priority one). Ferry everything you’ve found to the altar. Drop each item. Sort your pack into blessed, uncursed, and cursed piles. Wield or wear the blessed stuff. Stash or discard the cursed stuff.</p>
<p><strong>At a shop</strong> (priority two). Pick up and put down unidentified items to get price quotes. Group them by price. Cross-reference with the tables above. Suddenly half your inventory is narrowed to two or three possibilities.</p>
<p><strong>Engrave-test your wands</strong> as soon as you find them. It’s fast, it costs only one charge, and it immediately sorts wands into categories. A wand that digs the floor is digging. A wand that freezes your engraving is cold. Simple.</p>
<p><strong>Experiment cautiously</strong> with the rest. Wear non-cursed rings one at a time. Throw potions at monsters. Read scrolls from safe price groups after removing your armor.</p>
<p><strong>Save your scrolls of identify</strong> for the items that resist other methods: amulets (all the same price), spellbooks (dangerous to read if unknown), and the one stubborn potion in the $50 group that you can’t quite pin down.</p>

<h3 id="provisions-and-dining">Provisions and Dining</h3>
<p>Hunger is a clock. Every turn you spend in the dungeon costs nutrition, and when the tank hits empty, you faint. Faint a few times without eating and you die. Managing your food supply is not glamorous, but it is essential.</p>
<h4 id="how-hunger-works">How Hunger Works</h4>
<p>Your nutrition starts at 900 and ticks down steadily. The rate depends on what you’re doing:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Base consumption</strong> costs 1 point per turn (less while sleeping).</li>
<li><strong>Regeneration</strong> (from a ring or intrinsic) costs extra on odd turns.</li>
<li><strong>Encumbrance</strong> costs extra on odd turns if you’re burdened or worse.</li>
<li><strong>Rings</strong> cause additional hunger while worn. Two rings drain faster.</li>
</ul>
<p>When nutrition drops below certain thresholds, you get warnings:</p>

<p>The practical takeaway: eat when you get the “Hungry” message. Don’t wait for “Weak.” If you hit Fainting and have no food, pray to your god (see <a href="#divine-relations">Divine Relations</a>). Prayer cures hunger if your god is willing to help.</p>
<h4 id="what-to-eat">What to Eat</h4>
<p><strong>Food rations</strong> provide 800 nutrition and are the staple food. They weigh 20 and are common in shops. Stockpile these when you can.</p>
<p><strong>Lembas wafers</strong> are better: 800 nutrition at only 5 weight, the best ratio in the game. Elven characters find these more often.</p>
<p><strong>Corpses</strong> are the primary food source in the early game. Most fresh corpses provide nutrition proportional to the monster’s size. A few rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eat corpses within a few turns of the kill, or they rot and cause food poisoning (lethal without treatment).</li>
<li>Never eat old corpses. If in doubt, don’t eat it.</li>
<li>Some corpses grant intrinsic resistances (poison resistance from killer bees, fire resistance from fire giants, etc.). Eat these deliberately.</li>
<li>Some corpses are harmful (floating eyes paralyze you, green slimes turn you into slime, cockatrice corpses kill you). Know which corpses are safe before eating.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tripe rations</strong> are terrible for you (your character retches) but pets love them. Save tripe for your pet.</p>
<p><strong>Tins</strong> are preserved food that never spoil. They take several turns to open (one turn with a tin opener, three with a dagger, more with bare hands). Blessed tins open instantly. A tin of spinach increases your strength.</p>
<h4 id="dangerous-foods">Dangerous Foods</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cockatrice corpse:</strong> instant death by stoning. Never eat this.</li>
<li><strong>Acidic corpses</strong> (acid blob, etc.): damage unless acid resistant.</li>
<li><strong>Poisonous corpses:</strong> damage and stat drain unless poison resistant.</li>
<li><strong>Rotten corpses:</strong> food poisoning. Pray immediately if affected.</li>
<li><strong>Cannibalism</strong> (eating your own race): costs 2 to 5 luck and gives the aggravate monster intrinsic. Cavemen and orcs are exempt.</li>

<h3 id="the-apothecary">The Apothecary</h3>
<p>Potions are common finds in the dungeon, appearing as colorful liquids in randomized bottles. The color tells you nothing about the contents until you’ve identified that color for this game. A “smoky potion” might be healing in one game and paralysis in the next.</p>

<p>Water is the oddity in the $100 group – it appears as “clear potion” and is always identifiable on sight. Healing sits alone at $20, making it one of the easiest potions to price-identify.</p>
<h4 id="key-potions">Key Potions</h4>
<p><strong>Healing, extra healing, full healing.</strong> The healing chain. Extra healing is the workhorse, curing blindness and sickness in addition to restoring hit points. Blessed extra healing and full healing also raise your maximum HP. Stockpile these.</p>
<p><strong>Gain ability.</strong> Raises all stats by 1 when blessed, or one random stat when uncursed. Extremely valuable. Save these until you can bless them.</p>
<p><strong>Speed.</strong> Grants the speed intrinsic, which is one of the most important buffs in the game. Quaff one blessed potion of speed and you’re faster for the rest of the game.</p>
<p><strong>Holy water.</strong> Created by dropping uncursed water potions on a co-aligned altar and praying. Holy water (blessed water) can bless items you dip into it. This is the foundation of item management: bless your scrolls of identify, your potions of gain ability, your scrolls of enchant weapon. Stockpile holy water aggressively.</p>
<p><strong>Gain level.</strong> Raises your experience level by one. Useful for reaching quest eligibility. More importantly, reading a confused scroll of teleportation while standing on the right square can interact with this in complex ways.</p>
<h4 id="alchemy">Alchemy</h4>
<p>Potions can be mixed by dipping one into another. Most random combinations produce useless results (or explosions), but a few recipes are reliable and valuable:</p>

<p>The chain from healing up to gain ability via gain energy or gain level is the core alchemy sequence. If you find potions of gain energy (cheap and common), you can upgrade your healing potions into much more valuable ones.</p>
<pre><code>  The Alchemy Upgrade Chain

  healing ($20)
     |  + gain energy/level
     v
  extra healing ($100)
     |  + gain energy/level
     v
  full healing ($200)
     |  + gain energy/level
     v
  gain ability ($300)  &lt;-- the jackpot

  Side chain:
  fruit juice ($50)  --+ gain energy/level--&gt;  see invisible ($50)
  speed ($200)  --+ healing--&gt;  extra healing
  speed ($200)  --+ extra healing--&gt;  levitation ($200)</code></pre>
<p>Start from the bottom (healing) and work your way up. A single potion of gain energy can convert a $20 healing potion into a $100 extra healing. Two gain energies turn it into $200 full healing. Three, and you’ve got $300 gain ability from a $20 investment. This is the best deal in the dungeon.</p>
<p>There is a 10% chance of explosion on any non-water mixture, so do this in a safe place. Cursed potions always explode when used as the dipping target.</p>
<h4 id="unicorn-horn-interactions">Unicorn Horn Interactions</h4>
<p>Dipping a unicorn horn into certain potions converts them:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blindness, confusion, hallucination</strong> become uncursed water.</li>
<li><strong>Sickness</strong> becomes fruit juice.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is useful for cleaning up dangerous potions you’ve accidentally picked up, or for generating water for holy water production.</p>

<h3 id="the-scroll-rack">The Scroll Rack</h3>
<p>Scrolls are single-use magical documents that produce effects when read. They appear with random labels (“ZELGO MER,” “DAIYEN FOOELS,” and so on) that are consistent within a game but randomized between games.

<p>The $20 scroll is always identify, the most common and most useful scroll in the game. The $60 group is very valuable (enchant weapon). The $80 group is similarly good (enchant armor, remove curse). The $100 group is large and mixed, containing both excellent scrolls (magic mapping, teleportation) and dangerous ones (destroy armor).</p>
<h4 id="key-scrolls">Key Scrolls</h4>
<p><strong>Identify.</strong> The workhorse. Use it on items that resist other identification methods. Blessed identify may identify multiple items at once (with positive luck, always at least two).</p>
<p><strong>Enchant weapon and enchant armor.</strong> These raise the enchantment of your wielded weapon or a random piece of worn armor by +1 (uncursed) or potentially more (blessed). Save these until you have your endgame gear, then bless them and use them. Enchanting beyond +5 risks destroying the item, but blessed scrolls can safely push higher.</p>
<p><strong>Remove curse.</strong> Uncurses worn and wielded items. Blessed remove curse uncurses everything in your main inventory. Essential if you’ve accidentally put on a cursed item.</p>
<p><strong>Charging.</strong> Recharges wands and other items. Save these for your wand of wishing (to get an extra wish or two) or other critical wands. Blessed charging gives more charges. Don’t recharge a wand too many times, as the explosion chance increases with each recharge.</p>
<p><strong>Genocide.</strong> Eliminates a monster species (uncursed) or an entire monster class (blessed) from the game permanently. Use it on liches, mind flayers, or whatever is causing you the most trouble. Confused reading genocides your own race, which kills you.</p>
<p><strong>Magic mapping.</strong> Reveals the entire level layout. Blessed also reveals secret doors. Extremely useful in Gehennom’s mazes.</p>
<p><strong>Scare monster.</strong> Don’t read it. Drop it on the floor and stand on it. It works like a permanent Elbereth, frightening most monsters. Pick it up and it crumbles to dust (if it has ever been dropped before).</p>
<p><strong>Teleportation.</strong> Teleports you randomly on the level (uncursed) or to a different level (cursed or confused). With teleport control, you choose the destination.</p>
<h4 id="confused-reading">Confused Reading</h4>
<p>Many scrolls have different effects when read while confused. Some useful confused readings:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Confused remove curse</strong> has a 25% chance of blessing or cursing each uncursed item (risky but sometimes useful for creating holy water: confuse-read remove curse while wielding uncursed water).</li>
<li><strong>Confused destroy armor</strong> actually erodeproofs a piece of armor.</li>
<li><strong>Confused enchant armor</strong> erodeproofs a piece of armor.</li>
<li><strong>Confused enchant weapon</strong> erodeproofs your weapon.</li>
<li><strong>Confused genocide</strong> genocides your own role. Don’t do this.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="wands-and-staves">Wands and Staves</h3>
<p>Wands are reusable magical items that produce directed effects when zapped.

<h4 id="key-wands">Key Wands</h4>
<p><strong>Wishing.</strong> The most valuable item in the game. Each zap grants one wish. Wands of wishing start with 1 to 3 charges and can be recharged once (and only once) with a scroll of charging. Blessed charging on a 0-charge wand of wishing gives 1 to 3 charges. Plan your wishes carefully before you find one.</p>
<p><strong>Death.</strong> Fires a death ray that instantly kills most things it hits. Reflected by reflection. Blocked by magic resistance. One of the best offensive tools in the late game.</p>
<p><strong>Digging.</strong> Essential utility. Dig through walls to create shortcuts, dig down to escape dangerous situations, dig through rock to reach vaults and hidden areas. Every ascension kit should include a wand of digging.</p>
<p><strong>Teleportation.</strong> Zap monsters to send them somewhere else on the level. Zap yourself to teleport. Enormously useful for escaping trouble or removing a dangerous monster from your path.</p>
<p><strong>Fire, cold, lightning.</strong> Offensive ray wands that bounce off walls. Fire burns scrolls and spellbooks on the floor. Cold freezes water (useful for creating paths). Lightning blinds monsters.</p>
<p><strong>Cancellation.</strong> Removes special properties from items and monsters. A cancelled monster loses most of its special attacks. Do NOT put this wand in a bag of holding (it will explode the bag). Keep it separate in your main inventory.</p>
<p><strong>Polymorph.</strong> Transforms monsters into random other monsters and items into random other items of the same class. Can be used creatively (polymorph a pile of junk armor hoping for dragon scale mail, polymorph a weak monster hoping for a useful corpse). Risky but powerful.</p>
<h4 id="identification-by-engraving">Identification by Engraving</h4>
<p>The engrave test (described in <a href="#the-identification-problem">The Identification Problem</a>) is the fastest way to sort wands. Every wand type produces a distinctive result when used to engrave on the floor.</p>
<h4 id="recharging">Recharging</h4>
<p>Wands can be recharged with a scroll of charging. Each recharge increases the risk of the wand exploding. The formula is (recharges cubed) / 343, so:</p>
<ul>
<li>First recharge: 0.3% explosion chance.</li>
<li>Second: 2.3%.</li>
<li>Third: 7.9%.</li>
<li>Seventh: 100%.</li>
</ul>
<p>Wands of wishing can only be recharged once before they explode automatically. Use blessed charging for the best results.</p>
<h4 id="wresting">Wresting</h4>
<p>When a wand has 0 charges, you can still try to zap it. There is a 1/121 chance of “wresting” one final charge from the wand before it turns to dust. This is a last resort, but it works on wands of wishing too.</p>

<p>Rings that say “auto-curse” generate cursed 90% of the time. If you put on a ring and find you can’t remove it, it’s probably one of these.</p>
<p><strong>Essential rings:</strong> Free action (prevents paralysis, critical for endgame), teleport control (turns random teleportation into controlled transportation), conflict (monsters attack each other instead of you, excellent for crowded levels), slow digestion (wear between meals to conserve food).</p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> All rings cause additional hunger while worn. Wearing two rings drains your food supply noticeably faster. Remove rings you don’t currently need.</p>

<p><strong>Amulet of life saving</strong> is the most important. Wear it in dangerous situations (endgame, unfamiliar special levels). When it triggers, you come back with full HP but the amulet is gone.</p>
<p><strong>Amulet of reflection</strong> is excellent if you didn’t get the shield of reflection elsewhere. It frees up your shield slot.</p>
<p><strong>Amulet of magical breathing</strong> prevents drowning, which matters at Medusa’s level and on the Plane of Water.</p>
<h4 id="identification">Identification</h4>
<p>Rings and amulets are tricky to identify because many have subtle effects. The methods from <a href="#the-identification-problem">The Identification Problem</a> apply: sink-drop for rings, wear-test for both.

<p>A <strong>bag of holding</strong> is one of the most important items in the game. Blessed, it reduces the weight of contents to roughly 1/4. This lets you carry your entire supply of potions, scrolls, and backup gear without being burdened. Get one from Sokoban or wish for one.</p>
<p>Never put a wand of cancellation, another bag of holding, or a charged bag of tricks inside a bag of holding. The bag will explode, scattering your items across the floor (in current editions, items are scattered rather than destroyed, but it’s still catastrophic).</p>
<h4 id="unlocking-tools">Unlocking Tools</h4>
<p>A <strong>skeleton key</strong> is the best: 70%+ success rate on doors, 75%+ on boxes. A <strong>lock pick</strong> is decent. A <strong>credit card</strong> is worst but still useful. Always carry one of these.</p>
<h4 id="light-sources">Light Sources</h4>
<p><strong>Oil lamps</strong> and <strong>candles</strong> provide light in dark areas. A <strong>magic lamp</strong> is special: rubbing it has a chance of releasing a djinni who may grant a wish (80% chance with a blessed lamp). Don’t waste your magic lamp on light. Rub it while blessed for the wish.</p>
<p>The <strong>Candelabrum of Invocation</strong> is a unique candelabra found in Vlad’s Tower. It’s one of three items needed for the invocation ritual to enter Moloch’s Sanctum. You’ll need seven candles to attach to it.</p>
<h4 id="musical-instruments">Musical Instruments</h4>
<p>Instruments can be played to produce various effects. A <strong>tooled horn</strong> or <strong>bugle</strong> is needed to play the passtune at the Castle drawbridge. A <strong>magic harp</strong> or <strong>magic flute</strong> tames or puts monsters to sleep. A <strong>drum of earthquake</strong> creates pits around you.</p>
<p>Leather drums and wooden instruments are non-magical variants that produce noise but no special effects.</p>

<p>A <strong>unicorn horn</strong> is one of the best tools in the game. Apply it to cure confusion, blindness, sickness, hallucination, and nausea. Always carry one.</p>
<p>A <strong>magic marker</strong> lets you write scrolls of identify, enchant weapon, enchant armor, and other useful scrolls on blank paper. Charges are limited, so use them wisely. Writing scrolls you’ve already identified costs fewer charges.</p>

<h3 id="the-armory">The Armory</h3>
<p>Weapons and armor are the bread and butter of combat. Your choice of equipment determines how hard you hit, how well you dodge, and what special resistances you carry.</p>
<h4 id="armor-and-ac">Armor and AC</h4>
<p>Armor Class (AC) starts at 10 and decreases as you add protection. Lower is better. Each point of AC reduces the chance of being hit. At AC -10 or below, you’re quite difficult to damage with physical attacks.</p>
<p>The key armor slots:</p>

<p><strong>Gray dragon scale mail</strong> (magic resistance) is the most popular wish target by far. Magic resistance blocks a wide range of instant-death attacks and hostile magic. If your role’s quest artifact already provides magic resistance, wish for silver (reflection) instead.</p>
<p><strong>How to get dragon scale mail:</strong> Kill a dragon, pick up the scales it drops, then read a scroll of enchant armor while wearing the scales (they transform into scale mail at the same enchantment level). Or wish for the mail directly. Wishing is more efficient but scales-into-mail lets you use wishes elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Speed boots</strong> are critical. Being faster than your enemies means you get more turns, which means more chances to attack, cast spells, or run away.</p>
<p><strong>Cloak of magic resistance</strong> is one of the most important pieces of equipment in the game, providing magic resistance in the cloak slot and freeing up other slots for different resistances.</p>

<p><strong>Excalibur</strong> (long sword dipped in a fountain while Lawful) is one of the best weapons: +d5 to hit and damage, level drain resistance, automatic searching. For Lawful characters, getting Excalibur early is a priority.</p>
<p><strong>Silver saber</strong> deserves special mention. Many endgame threats (demons, undead, werecreatures) are vulnerable to silver. A silver saber does an extra d20 damage against them, making it one of the best late-game weapons.</p>
<p><strong>Your quest artifact</strong> is often your primary weapon or at least worth carrying for its properties. Check what your role’s artifact does.</p>
<h4 id="enchantment">Enchantment</h4>
<p>Weapons and armor can be enchanted using scrolls of enchant weapon and enchant armor. Each reading adds +1 (uncursed) or +1 to +3 (blessed, random). Going too high risks destroying the item.</p>
<p><strong>Safe enchantment limits:</strong></p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Item type</th>
<th>Uncursed scroll</th>
<th>Blessed scroll</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Weapon</td>
<td>+5</td>
<td>+7</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Armor</td>
<td>+3</td>
<td>+5</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Beyond these limits, there’s a chance the item evaporates. The risk increases with each level above the safe limit. A +7 artifact weapon lost to a greedy enchant scroll is the kind of mistake you only make once but remember forever.</p>
<p><strong>Tips:</strong> Always use blessed scrolls for enchanting valuable gear. To maximize, enchant to the uncursed safe limit with uncursed scrolls (cheap), then switch to blessed scrolls for the final push. Don’t enchant past +5 on armor or +7 on weapons unless you’re feeling genuinely reckless.</p>
<h4 id="erosion-and-proofing">Erosion and Proofing</h4>
<p>Weapons and armor can be damaged by rust (iron items), fire (organic items), and corrosion (copper items). A badly damaged item provides less AC or damage.</p>
<p>To fix erosion, read a confused scroll of enchant weapon (for your weapon) or confused scroll of enchant armor (for a random worn armor piece). This erodeproofs the item permanently without changing its enchantment. It also repairs any existing damage.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="artifacts">Artifacts</h3>
<p>Artifacts are unique named items with special powers. Each artifact can only exist once per game. They’re obtained through several means:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fountain dipping</strong> (Excalibur, for Lawful characters).</li>
<li><strong>Sacrifice</strong> on an altar (your god may gift you an aligned artifact).</li>
<li><strong>Quest completion</strong> (each role’s unique quest artifact).</li>
<li><strong>Wishing</strong> (you can wish for most artifacts, but they resist if they don’t match your alignment).</li>
<li><strong>Random generation</strong> (rare, but weapons have a small chance of being generated as an artifact).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="alignment-and-blasting">Alignment and Blasting</h4>
<p>Each artifact has an alignment. If you try to handle an artifact that doesn’t match your alignment:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intelligent artifacts</strong> (most quest artifacts): 8d6 damage and you drop the item. You cannot wield these.</li>
<li><strong>Other misaligned artifacts</strong>: 4d4 damage on first touch, 1/4 chance of being blasted each subsequent touch.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="non-quest-artifacts">Non-Quest Artifacts</h4>
<p>These can appear via sacrifice, wishing, or (for a few) special methods. Artifacts with an alignment restrict who can wield them comfortably; unaligned artifacts work for anyone.</p>

<p><strong>Excalibur</strong> is obtained by dipping a long sword in a fountain while Lawful at experience level 5 or higher. It’s the go-to weapon for Lawful characters: level drain resistance, automatic searching, and solid damage make it a complete package.</p>
<p><strong>Grayswandir</strong> is widely considered the best weapon in the game. It deals double damage against everything (not just silver-haters) and halves physical damage you take. Silver sabers also get +d20 against silver-vulnerable monsters (demons, undead, werecreatures), making Grayswandir devastating in the endgame.</p>
<p><strong>Mjollnir</strong> can be thrown and returns when you have 25 Strength. The +d24 lightning damage makes it one of the highest damage weapons, but it requires gauntlets of power or equivalent.</p>
<p><strong>Magicbane</strong> is valuable as a secondary carry item even if you don’t wield it: it provides magic resistance while wielded and blocks 95% of curses while carried. Get it early via sacrifice as a Wizard.</p>
<p><strong>Stormbringer</strong> drains levels from everything it hits, including peaceful monsters. This makes it powerful but socially hazardous. The level drain gives you +8 max HP per drain, making you progressively tougher.</p>
<h4 id="quest-artifacts">Quest Artifacts</h4>
<p>Each role has a unique quest artifact obtained by completing the quest dungeon around experience levels 14-16. These are intelligent and self-willed: they blast anyone who isn’t the intended role.</p>

<p>Many quest artifacts provide <strong>magic resistance</strong>, either as a defense property (while worn/wielded) or carry property (just having it in inventory). This makes your quest artifact essential to carry even if you never wield it. Roles whose quest artifact doesn’t grant MR (Barbarian, Ranger, Samurai) need to get it from dragon scale mail or a cloak instead.</p>

<h2 id="part-five-the-craft-of-adventuring">Part Five: The Craft of Adventuring</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Part Five draws on Matthew Lahut’s RGRN prayer guide, Steven Bush’s spellbook reading tables, and the Hugo/O’Donnell files on gods, combat, gems, and luck mechanics, all updated for the current edition.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h3 id="divine-relations">Divine Relations</h3>
<p>Your relationship with your god is one of the most important mechanics in the game. A happy god answers prayers, forgives transgressions, and occasionally sends gift artifacts. An angry god smites you.</p>
<h4 id="prayer">Prayer</h4>
<p>Praying (<code>#pray</code>) calls on your god for help. If your god is pleased with you and enough time has passed since your last prayer, good things happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you’re about to die (low HP, starvation, stoning, illness), your god fixes the problem.</li>
<li>Your god may fix other afflictions (blindness, confusion, punishment).</li>
<li>Your alignment record improves.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your god is displeased, or you pray too soon after a previous prayer, bad things happen instead: lightning strikes, loss of luck, or worse.</p>
<p><strong>Prayer timeout:</strong> After a successful prayer, you must wait roughly 300 to 600 turns before praying again. In Gehennom, prayers to non-Moloch gods don’t work at all (your god can’t hear you there). This makes Gehennom significantly more dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>When to pray:</strong> When you’re about to die and have no other option. Starvation (Weak or Fainting), lethal stoning in progress, food poisoning, and critically low HP are all valid reasons. Don’t waste prayers on minor inconveniences.</p>
<h4 id="sacrifice">Sacrifice</h4>
<p>Offering fresh monster corpses at an altar builds favor with your god. The rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>The corpse must be fresh (killed within the last few turns).</li>
<li>Bigger monsters are more valuable sacrifices.</li>
<li>The altar must match your alignment, or you’re praying to someone else’s god (which has its own consequences).</li>
<li>Same-race sacrifice is forbidden and severely punished (with one exception: it can convert an altar to your alignment).</li>
</ul>
<p>With enough sacrifice credit, your god may gift you an artifact weapon. The first gift comes after relatively modest sacrifice; subsequent gifts require substantially more. Gift artifacts are always aligned to your god and always match a weapon skill you can use.</p>
<h4 id="altars-and-alignment">Altars and Alignment</h4>
<p>You can convert an altar by sacrificing on a cross-aligned altar repeatedly. This is risky (the altar’s god will be angry) but useful if the only altar you’ve found doesn’t match your alignment. Having a co-aligned altar is essential for sacrifice, holy water production, and BUC testing.</p>
<h4 id="crowning">Crowning</h4>
<p>If your alignment record is very high (piously aligned, +20 or more) and you’re extremely lucky (Luck +10), a successful prayer may result in your god crowning you. You receive a title based on alignment:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lawful:</strong> Hand of Elbereth</li>
<li><strong>Neutral:</strong> Envoy of Balance</li>
<li><strong>Chaotic:</strong> Glory of Arioch</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Crowning grants six intrinsics at once: fire resistance, cold resistance, poison resistance, sleep resistance, shock resistance, and see invisible. Your god also gifts you a weapon: Excalibur (Lawful), Vorpal Blade (Neutral), or Stormbringer (Chaotic). Wizards receive a blessed spellbook of finger of death instead; Monks receive a blessed spellbook of restore ability.</p>
<p><strong>The drawback:</strong> After crowning, your average prayer timeout roughly doubles. This means you can pray far less often for the rest of the game. Since prayer is your ultimate emergency escape (the “oh no” button you press when everything goes wrong), this is a steep price. Many experienced players deliberately avoid crowning by keeping Luck below +10 or alignment below +20 when praying. Getting crowned accidentally – usually by being too pious for your own good – is one of the more ironic mid-game regrets.</p>
<h4 id="donating-to-priests">Donating to Priests</h4>
<p>Chatting with a peaceful, aligned priest in a temple lets you donate gold. The rewards scale with the amount donated relative to your experience level (XL):</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Donation amount</th>
<th>Result</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Nothing (0)</td>

<tr class="odd">

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Divine protection</strong> from the 400-600*XL tier grants intrinsic AC improvements that stack with worn armor. The protection chance decreases at lower AC values, with -10 as the hard limit. This is one of the only ways to improve AC beyond what equipment provides.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="the-art-of-combat">The Art of Combat</h3>
<p>Combat in the Mazes is more nuanced than “hit monster until it dies.” Understanding the underlying mechanics helps you pick the right fights and avoid the wrong ones.</p>
<h4 id="to-hit-calculation">To-Hit Calculation</h4>
<p>Whether you hit a monster depends on a d20 roll modified by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your experience level</li>
<li>Your weapon’s enchantment</li>
<li>Your Luck (up to +5 or -5)</li>
<li>Your Strength bonus</li>
<li>The monster’s AC</li>
</ul>
<p>You need to roll at or above (10 + defender’s AC - your modifiers). Since monster AC can be very low (negative numbers), high-level monsters can be hard to hit even with good equipment.</p>
<h4 id="damage">Damage</h4>
<p>Base damage depends on your weapon and whether the target is small or large (most weapons do different damage against each). Added to base damage:</p>
<ul>
<li>Weapon enchantment (+1 per point)</li>
<li>Strength bonus (up to +6 for STR 18/xx, or more)</li>
<li>Weapon skill bonus (depends on skill level)</li>
<li>Special bonuses (silver damage, artifact bonuses, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="ac-and-defense">AC and Defense</h4>
<p>Your AC determines how likely monsters are to hit you. Typical AC values for equipped characters:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Stage</th>
<th>Typical AC</th>
<th>Protection level</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Starting out</td>
<td>8 to 10</td>
<td>Nearly no protection</td>

</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Endgame</td>
<td>-20 to -10</td>
<td>Full kit, enchanted</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>At AC -20, almost nothing hits you with physical attacks. But many late-game threats use special attacks (breath weapons, spells, gaze attacks) that ignore AC entirely. AC is necessary but not sufficient.</p>
<h4 id="two-weapon-combat">Two-Weapon Combat</h4>
<p>Some roles can fight with a weapon in each hand. This gives more attacks per turn but splits your skill and enchantment bonuses. Two-weapon combat is powerful for roles with high skill caps in it (Rangers, Barbarians) but mediocre for others.</p>
<h4 id="fighting-smart">Fighting Smart</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use corridors.</strong> Monsters can only approach one at a time in a corridor. Never fight multiple monsters in an open room if you can retreat to a chokepoint.</li>
<li><strong>Fight at range.</strong> Wands, thrown weapons, and spells let you damage monsters before they reach you. This is especially important against monsters with dangerous melee attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Know when to run.</strong> If a fight is going badly, use a scroll of teleportation, a wand of teleportation, or just run. Dead adventurers don’t get second chances (unless wearing an amulet of life saving).</li>
<li><strong>Use conflict.</strong> A ring of conflict makes monsters fight each other. Walk into a room full of enemies, put on the ring, and watch them destroy each other while you stand in the doorway.</li>
<li><strong>Elbereth for emergencies.</strong> Write it, stand on it, recover.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="wishes-and-wishing">Wishes and Wishing</h3>
<p>Wishes are the most powerful mechanic in the game. A well-timed wish for the right item can turn a struggling run into a winning one. But wishes are rare and can’t be wasted.</p>
<h4 id="sources-of-wishes">Sources of Wishes</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wand of wishing:</strong> 1 to 3 charges, found in the Castle treasure room. Rechargeable once.</li>
<li><strong>Magic lamp:</strong> Rub a blessed lamp for an 80% chance of a wish.</li>
<li><strong>Fountain:</strong> ~1 in 30 chance of a wish per quaff. Unreliable.</li>
<li><strong>Throne:</strong> Very rare chance of a wish when sitting.</li>
<li><strong>Djinni from smoky potion:</strong> Rare (1 in 13 base probability), and even then only 20% wish chance (80% if blessed).</li>
</ul>
<p>Most games give you 3 to 5 wishes total, primarily from the Castle wand and a magic lamp. Plan ahead.</p>
<h4 id="what-to-wish-for">What to Wish For</h4>
<p>The conventional priority list. Wish for the first thing you don’t already have:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Gray dragon scale mail</strong> – Magic resistance is the single most important resistance. Skip if your quest artifact provides it (Wizard, Monk, several others).</li>
<li><strong>Silver dragon scale mail</strong> – Reflection stops many instadeath attacks. Skip if you have an amulet of reflection or shield of reflection.</li>
<li><strong>Speed boots</strong> – Being faster than enemies is transformative. Skip if you already have speed intrinsic or boots.</li>
<li><strong>Gauntlets of power</strong> – STR 25 gives massive damage and carry bonuses. Best for melee-heavy roles.</li>
<li><strong>Amulet of life saving</strong> – Insurance for the endgame. One mistake doesn’t end your run.</li>
<li><strong>Grayswandir</strong> – The best weapon in the game (double damage, silver saber). Other good artifact wishes: Frost Brand, Dragonbane.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Conditional priorities by role:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wizard/Monk:</strong> Skip GDSM (quest artifact provides MR). Start with SDSM, then speed boots, then cloak of protection.</li>
<li><strong>Valkyrie:</strong> If Lawful, you already have Excalibur. Wish for GDSM, then SDSM, then Grayswandir if you want to dual-wield.</li>
<li><strong>Barbarian/Samurai:</strong> No intrinsic MR source. GDSM is essential.</li>
<li><strong>Tourist:</strong> Everything. You need it all. GDSM first.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Never waste wishes on:</strong> - Consumables you can find (scrolls, potions, food). - Items you can get from polymorph piles (random armor, weapons). - Artifacts that are already generated (the wish fails). - The Amulet of Yendor (nice try). - Gold (you get a handful; it’s not worth a wish).</p>
<p><strong>Common mistakes:</strong> - Wishing for “dragon scale mail” without specifying gray, silver, or another color. You’ll get a random color. - Forgetting to say “blessed” – you get uncursed +0 by default. - Wishing for something you could have found or polypiled for. - Wishing for a second amulet of life saving when you still need key resistances.</p>
<h4 id="wish-syntax">Wish Syntax</h4>
<p>When the game asks “For what do you wish?”, be specific:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>blessed +3 gray dragon scale mail</code> – Gets you exactly that.</li>
<li><code>gray dragon scale mail</code> – Gets uncursed +0. Fine but wasteful.</li>
<li><code>blessed greased +3 silver dragon scale mail</code> – Yes, you can request greased items.</li>
<li><code>2 blessed scrolls of genocide</code> – You can wish for multiples of some items.</li>
<li>Artifacts: can only wish for one that hasn’t been generated yet. Cross-aligned artifacts have a chance to resist your wish.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="spellcasting">Spellcasting</h3>
<p>Spells are reusable abilities learned from spellbooks. Unlike scrolls (which are consumed on use) or wands (which have limited charges), spells can be cast repeatedly as long as you have mana (Pw, power) and the spell hasn’t expired from memory.</p>
<h4 id="learning-spells">Learning Spells</h4>
<p>Read a spellbook to learn the spell it contains. Reading takes several turns and can fail:</p>
<ul>
<li>Higher-level spells are harder to learn.</li>
<li>Intelligence and role affect success rate.</li>
<li>Cursed spellbooks may paralyze you or summon monsters.</li>
<li>Blessed spellbooks are easier to learn from.</li>
<li>Each spell stays in memory for ~20,000 turns, then must be relearned.</li>
</ul>
<p>Wizards are the best spellcasters: they learn faster, fail less, and have the widest range of useful spells. Other roles can cast some spells but with less efficiency.</p>

<p>For Wizards, learning <strong>identify</strong> and <strong>magic mapping</strong> as spells dramatically reduces your need for scrolls of those types. <strong>Finger of death</strong> is the ultimate offensive spell. <strong>Charm monster</strong> gives you powerful allies.</p>
<h4 id="mana-management">Mana Management</h4>
<p>Your power (Pw) pool determines how many spells you can cast before resting. Power regenerates over time (faster with higher Wisdom and with a regeneration source). The Energy Vortex trick: allow an energy vortex to hit you while carrying an amulet of reflection, and it will increase your maximum power.</p>
<p>High-level spells cost significant power. You can’t spam finger of death unless you have a very large power pool. Plan your casting and carry backup options (wands, scrolls) for when your mana runs low.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="curses-and-how-to-break-them">Curses and How to Break Them</h3>
<p>Cursed items are items that have been touched by malign influence. They cling to you, malfunction, or actively harm you.</p>
<h4 id="how-items-get-cursed">How Items Get Cursed</h4>
<ul>
<li>Generated cursed (some item types, like rings of teleportation, are almost always cursed).</li>
<li>Stepping on a cursed item in a bones level (80% curse chance on bones items).</li>
<li>A monster cursing your inventory.</li>
<li>Reading a confused scroll of remove curse.</li>
<li>Contact with unholy water.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="effects-of-cursed-items">Effects of Cursed Items</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cursed worn armor and rings</strong> can’t be removed. You’re stuck with them until the curse is lifted.</li>
<li><strong>Cursed weapons</strong> can’t be unwielded.</li>
<li><strong>Cursed potions</strong> may have reversed or worsened effects.</li>
<li><strong>Cursed scrolls</strong> often do the opposite of what you want.</li>
<li><strong>Cursed tools</strong> malfunction. A cursed bag of holding doubles the weight of its contents instead of reducing it.</li>
<li><strong>Cursed food</strong> doesn’t taste great but isn’t usually lethal.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="detecting-curses">Detecting Curses</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Altar test.</strong> Drop an item on an altar. Black flash means cursed.</li>
<li><strong>Pet test.</strong> Your pet refuses to step on cursed items.</li>
<li><strong>Priest test.</strong> A temple priest will identify BUC status for a fee.</li>
<li><strong>Scroll of identify.</strong> Always reveals the full status.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="removing-curses">Removing Curses</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scroll of remove curse.</strong> Uncursed version uncurses worn and wielded items. Blessed version uncurses everything in your inventory.</li>
<li><strong>Holy water.</strong> Dip a cursed item in holy water: it becomes uncursed.</li>
<li><strong>Prayer.</strong> A pleased god will uncurse your worn items as part of answering a prayer (though praying just to uncurse items is wasteful).</li>
</ul>
<p>Always carry holy water and a scroll of remove curse for emergencies. Getting stuck with a cursed ring of teleportation or cursed levitation boots is a common way runs go sideways.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="luck-and-fortune">Luck and Fortune</h3>
<p>Luck is a hidden number that affects nearly everything you do. Combat, prayer, wishes, item generation, scroll effects, and more are all influenced by your Luck value. Understanding how it works and how to maintain it is important.</p>
<h4 id="how-luck-works">How Luck Works</h4>
<p>Luck ranges from -13 to +13. It starts at 0 and drifts back toward 0 over time. Positive luck makes good outcomes more likely; negative luck makes bad outcomes more likely.</p>
<p><strong>Luck timeout.</strong> Every 600 turns, your luck moves one point toward 0. If you have +5 luck, it will drop to +4 after 600 turns, then +3 after 1200 turns, and so on, eventually reaching 0.</p>
<p><strong>Luckstone.</strong> Carrying a luckstone in your open inventory (not inside a container) prevents luck from timing out. Your luck stays wherever it is until something changes it. This is why getting the luckstone from Mine’s End is so important.</p>

<p>Many other actions affect luck. The general pattern: virtuous actions raise it, destructive or dishonest actions lower it.</p>
<h4 id="why-luck-matters">Why Luck Matters</h4>
<p>At Luck +5 (or higher, with a luckstone):</p>
<ul>
<li>You hit more often in combat.</li>
<li>Your prayers are more likely to be answered.</li>
<li>Scrolls of enchant weapon/armor are more effective.</li>
<li>Wands of wishing are more likely to work perfectly.</li>
<li>Fountain wishes become slightly more likely.</li>
</ul>
<p>At negative luck, all of these go wrong. Some effects are catastrophic: at Luck -10 or worse, prayer always fails and many items don’t work as intended.</p>
<p>The practical advice: get a luckstone early, sacrifice occasionally to keep luck positive, and don’t kill peacefuls.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="polymorph">Polymorph</h3>
<p>Polymorph is one of the most versatile and dangerous mechanics in the game. It transforms monsters, items, or even you into something else. Used well, it’s a powerful tool. Used poorly, it’s a disaster.</p>
<h4 id="self-polymorph">Self-Polymorph</h4>
<p>Quaffing a potion of polymorph, being hit by a polymorph trap, or zapping yourself with a wand of polymorph transforms you into a random monster. This is dangerous without preparation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>You might become something weak</strong> (a newt, a grid bug) and die immediately to nearby threats.</li>
<li><strong>Your items might not fit</strong> your new form. Armor breaks or falls off, rings slip free from clawless forms.</li>
<li><strong>You lose your spellcasting</strong> in many forms.</li>
<li><strong>Your HP are replaced</strong> by the monster’s. When you revert (or die in that form), you return to your original HP.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Controlled polymorph</strong> (via polymorph control from a ring or intrinsic) lets you choose your form. This changes everything. Useful forms:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Form</th>
<th>Why</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Xorn</td>
<td>Phase through walls, eat metal</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Vampire lord</td>
<td>Fly, drain life, regeneration</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Air elemental</td>
<td>Very fast, phases, hard to hit</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Master mind flayer</td>
<td>Brain-eating attacks, psychic resistance</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Giant</td>
<td>High carrying capacity and damage</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Dragon (any)</td>
<td>Fly, breathe, thick hide, good damage</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Polymorphing into a form that has useful intrinsics (fire resistance from a red dragon, for instance) grants those intrinsics while you remain in that form. Revert and they vanish.</p>
<p><strong>Polymorph control</strong> is essential before experimenting with self-polymorph. Without it, self-polymorph is Russian roulette with four chambers loaded. Don’t do it.</p>
<h4 id="item-polymorph">Item Polymorph</h4>
<p>Zapping a pile of items with polymorph transforms each into a random item of the same class. This is one of the most powerful production techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pile of junk armor</strong> → chance of dragon scale mail, speed boots, or other rare armor.</li>
<li><strong>Pile of bad potions</strong> → chance of gain ability, full healing, gain level.</li>
<li><strong>Pile of useless scrolls</strong> → chance of enchant weapon, enchant armor, genocide.</li>
</ul>
<p>The trick: polymorph many items at once for the best odds. A pile of 20 junk armor pieces gives you 20 chances to hit something good. Items retain their blessed/cursed status but lose enchantment.</p>
<p><strong>Important cautions:</strong> - Artifacts cannot be polymorphed. - Wands of polymorph have limited charges. Don’t waste them on single items. - Named items and artifacts resist polymorph. - Items in a container are unaffected.</p>
<h4 id="monster-polymorph">Monster Polymorph</h4>
<p>Zapping a wand of polymorph at monsters transforms them randomly. This is useful in several situations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Turn a tough monster into something weaker</strong> (unreliable but worth trying in desperation).</li>
<li><strong>Polymorph a tame monster</strong> to get a more powerful pet.</li>
<li><strong>Polymorph a monster</strong> hoping it becomes something whose corpse grants a useful intrinsic (a chameleon strategy).</li>
</ul>
<p>The risk: the monster might polymorph into something <em>worse</em>. Zapping a gnome and getting a titan is the kind of lesson you only need to learn once.</p>

<h2 id="part-six-the-deep-dungeon">Part Six: The Deep Dungeon</h2>
<hr />
<h3 id="the-castle-1">The Castle</h3>
<p>We covered the Castle’s location and how to enter it in <a href="#branches-and-landmarks">Branches and Landmarks</a>. Here’s what to do once you’re inside.</p>
<p>The Castle is across a moat. You’ll need levitation, a drawbridge (lowered by playing a note with the passtune or a wand of opening), or another way across. The passtune is five notes played on a tonal instrument (bugle, tooled horn, etc.) – experiment or check a bones file.</p>
<p>The Castle contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>throne room</strong> with a throne and guards. Sitting on the throne is tempting but risky (see <a href="#points-of-interest">Points of Interest</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Barracks</strong> with soldiers carrying decent equipment (shields, long swords, lances, crossbows). Kill or conflict them.</li>
<li><strong>Treasure rooms</strong> behind secret doors along the outer walls. One contains the <strong>wand of wishing</strong> in a locked chest. Search all four corners systematically.</li>
<li>A <strong>maze section</strong> patrolled by a minotaur. The minotaur hits hard but isn’t magic-resistant.</li>
<li><strong>The Bell of Opening</strong> on the east side, needed for the Invocation ritual later.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="castle-tactics">Castle Tactics</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Ring of conflict first.</strong> Put it on before entering the barracks. Soldiers and guards will fight each other while you watch from a doorway. Pick off survivors.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Search for secret doors.</strong> The treasure rooms are hidden behind walls on the north and south sides. Search (or zap a wand of secret door detection) along every wall.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Loot the wand of wishing carefully.</strong> The chest may be trapped. Use your thiefing skills or a wand to disarm it. The wand typically has 1-3 charges and can be recharged once. See <a href="#wishes-and-wishing">Wishes and Wishing</a> for what to wish for.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pick up the Bell of Opening.</strong> You’ll need it much later for the Invocation. Don’t leave without it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Prepare fully before descending.</strong> The staircase down leads to Gehennom, where you cannot pray. Once you go, you’re committed.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="pre-gehennom-checklist">Pre-Gehennom Checklist</h4>
<p>Before descending from the Castle, make sure you have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Magic resistance (quest artifact, gray DSM, or cloak)</li>
<li>Reflection (silver DSM, amulet, or shield)</li>
<li>Fire and cold resistance (armor, rings, or intrinsic)</li>
<li>Poison resistance (intrinsic or armor)</li>
<li>Speed boots (or intrinsic speed)</li>
<li>A wand of digging (for maze navigation)</li>
<li>A unicorn horn (for status curing)</li>
<li>Plenty of food (you can’t pray for it below)</li>
<li>Holy water and scrolls of remove curse</li>
<li>Scrolls of teleportation and identify</li>
<li>Your quest artifact</li>
<li>The Bell of Opening</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re missing critical items, go back up. Many runs die in Gehennom because the player descended underprepared.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="gehennom">Gehennom</h3>
<p>Gehennom is the second half of the dungeon, and it’s a different experience from everything above. The levels are mazes, the monsters are demons, and your god can’t hear your prayers here.</p>
<p>Consider this your travel advisory: Gehennom is hostile territory from the moment you arrive.</p>

    Moloch&#39;s Sanctum (Amulet of Yendor)</code></pre>
<p>The demon lairs are scattered throughout the maze levels. You don’t have to fight every demon lord, but you do have to pass through their levels. Vlad’s Tower and the Wizard’s Tower are side branches you must visit to collect the Invocation items.</p>
<h4 id="whats-different">What’s Different</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>No prayer.</strong> Your god cannot hear you in Gehennom (unless you worship Moloch). This means no emergency healing, no food rescue, no curse removal via prayer. You are on your own.</li>
<li><strong>Fire everywhere.</strong> Fire traps are common. Many monsters breathe fire. Make sure you have fire resistance.</li>
<li><strong>Demon lords.</strong> Named demon lords (Orcus, Baalzebub, Asmodeus, Juiblex, Yeenoghu, Demogorgon) appear on specific levels. Each is a major fight. Some can summon other demons.</li>
<li><strong>Teleportation restrictions.</strong> You can’t teleport on most Gehennom levels. This limits your escape options.</li>
<li><strong>Mazes.</strong> Most Gehennom levels are mazes rather than rooms and corridors. A wand of digging or pickaxe is essential for cutting through walls.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="key-objectives-in-gehennom">Key Objectives in Gehennom</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Vlad’s Tower.</strong> A three-level tower within Gehennom. Vlad the Impaler (a vampire lord) sits at the top, guarding the Candelabrum of Invocation. Kill Vlad, take the Candelabrum.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Wizard’s Tower.</strong> The Wizard of Yendor is here, along with the Book of the Dead. The Wizard is extremely dangerous: he can teleport, summon monsters, steal the Amulet, and harass you for the rest of the game after you disturb him. Kill him, take the Book of the Dead.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The vibrating square.</strong> Somewhere on the level directly above Moloch’s Sanctum, there is a square that vibrates when you stand on it. This is where you perform the Invocation ritual.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Invocation.</strong> At the vibrating square, with the Candelabrum lit (7 candles attached), the Bell of Opening rung, and the Book of the Dead read, you open the passage to Moloch’s Sanctum.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Moloch’s Sanctum.</strong> The high priest of Moloch guards the Amulet of Yendor. Defeat him and take the Amulet. Then turn around and climb all the way back up through the entire dungeon.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="survival-tips">Survival Tips</h4>
<ul>
<li>Carry extra food. You can’t pray for it.</li>
<li>Carry scrolls of remove curse. You can’t pray curses away.</li>
<li>Dig through maze walls instead of navigating them.</li>
<li>Kill the Wizard fast. Once disturbed, he teleports to you periodically to harass you, steal items, and curse your gear. The sooner you end him (temporarily, he comes back), the fewer interruptions you’ll face.</li>
<li>Level teleportation out of Gehennom doesn’t work while you carry the Amulet. You must walk all the way up.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="the-ascension-run">The Ascension Run</h3>
<p>After taking the Amulet of Yendor from Moloch’s Sanctum, you need to carry it from the bottom of Gehennom all the way back to the surface and through the Elemental Planes. This is the Ascension Run, and it’s where many otherwise successful games end.</p>
<h4 id="endgame-checklist">Endgame Checklist</h4>
<p>Before you enter the ascension run, make sure you have:</p>
<p><strong>Resistances (all essential):</strong> - [ ] Fire resistance - [ ] Cold resistance - [ ] Shock resistance - [ ] Poison resistance - [ ] Disintegration resistance (black DSM or eaten corpse) - [ ] Magic resistance (quest artifact, gray DSM, or cloak) - [ ] Reflection (silver DSM, shield, or amulet) - [ ] Free action (ring or amulet)</p>
<p><strong>Equipment:</strong> - [ ] Speed boots (or intrinsic speed) - [ ] Levitation source (boots, ring, or potion) - [ ] Amulet of life saving (at least one backup) - [ ] Wand of death (for the Wizard, priests, other threats) - [ ] Wand of teleportation (for moving threats aside) - [ ] Wand of digging (for cutting through Gehennom mazes) - [ ] Scrolls of teleportation (for fast staircase access) - [ ] Magical breathing (amulet or spell, for Plane of Water) - [ ] Ring of conflict (invaluable on Elemental Planes) - [ ] Unicorn horn (for curing status effects)</p>
<p><strong>Invocation items (gathered in Gehennom):</strong> - [ ] Bell of Opening (from the Castle) - [ ] Candelabrum of Invocation (from Vlad) - [ ] 7 candles (attached to the Candelabrum) - [ ] Book of the Dead (from the Wizard of Yendor)</p>
<p><strong>Supplies:</strong> - [ ] Plenty of food (you can’t pray in Gehennom) - [ ] Holy water and scrolls of remove curse - [ ] Blank scrolls and magic marker (for emergency scrolls) - [ ] At least 2 scrolls of gold detection (for portals on the Elemental Planes, when confused)</p>
<p>If you’re missing critical items, go back for them. The dungeons above are still there, and they’re friendlier than what lies ahead. Many games are lost not to some terrible monster but to the simple fact that the player descended before they were ready.</p>
<h4 id="the-problems">The Problems</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Wizard of Yendor</strong> periodically teleports to you, summoning nasty monsters and trying to steal the Amulet. He will not stop. Kill him each time; he always comes back.</li>
<li><strong>The Amulet blocks teleportation.</strong> You can’t level teleport while carrying the Amulet. You must climb every staircase from Gehennom to the surface.</li>
<li><strong>Covetous monsters.</strong> Demon lords and the Wizard can warp to your position and attack. They specifically target you for the Amulet.</li>
<li><strong>The Mysterious Force.</strong> While carrying the Amulet in Gehennom, each time you climb stairs, there’s a chance you’ll be teleported to a random location on the level instead of going up. This doesn’t apply once you’re above Gehennom.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="strategy">Strategy</h4>
<p>Speed is the priority. Don’t fight everything. Don’t explore. Don’t loot. Just go up.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use your wand of digging to reach staircases quickly.</li>
<li>Zap problem monsters with teleportation or death wands.</li>
<li>If the Wizard shows up, kill him fast or teleport him away.</li>
<li>Use scrolls of teleportation on yourself to reach stairs faster (on levels where teleport works).</li>
<li>Elbereth is useful when you need a turn to recover.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you reach the top of the Dungeons of Doom, the final staircase leads to the Elemental Planes.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="the-elemental-planes">The Elemental Planes</h3>
<p>The Elemental Planes are the final gauntlet: four special levels between you and the Astral Plane. Each has a magic portal to the next plane, and you must reach it to progress.</p>
<h4 id="plane-of-earth">Plane of Earth</h4>
<p>A level packed with boulders and earth elementals. The portal is hidden somewhere in the level. Use a wand of digging to tunnel through boulders and walls. A crystal ball or scroll of magic mapping will reveal the portal’s location. Move fast; the level is claustrophobic and elementals hit hard.</p>
<h4 id="plane-of-air">Plane of Air</h4>
<p>An open expanse with no walls, just air. Air elementals are extremely fast and attack multiple times per turn. They cannot be genocided. A ring of conflict helps immensely (let them fight each other). A scroll of magic mapping reveals the portal. Being engulfed by a vortex can paradoxically help: the vortex carries you around the level, and if it happens to cross the portal, you’re through.</p>
<h4 id="plane-of-fire">Plane of Fire</h4>
<p>Fire everywhere. Everything is on fire. Fire resistance is mandatory. Fire elementals and other fire creatures fill the level. The portal is hidden among the flames. Map the level, find the portal, reach it.</p>
<h4 id="plane-of-water">Plane of Water</h4>
<p>Underwater. You need magical breathing (from an amulet or intrinsic) to survive here. The level is a series of water-filled chambers with occasional air pockets. Sea monsters will try to drown you. Find the portal and get through. This is the last obstacle before the Astral Plane.</p>
<h4 id="the-astral-plane">The Astral Plane</h4>
<p>The final level. Three altars line the central temple: one Lawful, one Neutral, one Chaotic. You must sacrifice the Amulet of Yendor on the altar matching your alignment to ascend and win the game.</p>
<pre><code>    Layout (approximate):

             and demons            and demons
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    You arrive here</code></pre>
<p>The three altars are always Lawful, Neutral, and Chaotic, but the left-to-right order is randomized each game. You must identify which altar matches your alignment before sacrificing.</p>
<p><strong>How to identify the correct altar:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Farlook</strong> (<code>/</code> then cursor to altar): If you can see an altar, this tells you its alignment directly. Fastest method.</li>
<li><strong>Chat with aligned priest</strong>: Each altar has a high priest nearby. If the priest is peaceful to you, it’s your alignment’s altar.</li>
<li><strong>#offer a junk item</strong>: Sacrificing on the wrong altar angers that god’s priest. On the right altar, your god responds.</li>
<li><strong>Telepathy</strong>: If you have intrinsic telepathy, you can sense the priests’ positions and guess from their behavior.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> Do NOT sacrifice the Amulet on the wrong altar. The wrong god keeps it, and you’ll need to defeat the now-hostile high priest to get it back. Test with a junk item first.</p>
<p>The Astral Plane is swarming with Angels, the three Riders (Death, Famine, Pestilence), and other powerful enemies. The Riders cannot be permanently killed. Your goal is not to fight everything but to reach the correct altar.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a wand of teleportation or conflict to clear a path.</li>
<li>Ring of conflict is enormously powerful here – the Angels fight each other instead of you.</li>
<li>The Riders will follow you. Don’t engage unless you have to.</li>
<li>Famine drains nutrition, Pestilence causes sickness, Death uses the touch of death. Magic resistance blocks Death’s touch.</li>
<li>If you sacrifice on the wrong altar, you’ll lose the Amulet and need to retrieve it.</li>
<li>Once you sacrifice on the correct altar: you ascend. You win. Congratulations.</li>

<h3 id="sokoban-solutions">Sokoban Solutions</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Boudewijn Waijers mapped solutions for all eight Sokoban level variants in 2001. The puzzles haven’t changed. His solutions still work.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sokoban is a fixed set of four puzzle floors, each with two possible layouts (A and B, randomly chosen). You push boulders onto holes to fill them, or onto traps to block them, clearing a path to the stairs up. You cannot pull boulders, so every push is permanent. One wrong move can make the level unsolvable.</p>
<p>The prize at the top is either a <strong>bag of holding</strong> (variant A) or an <strong>amulet of reflection</strong> (variant B).</p>
<p>A few universal rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No teleportation</strong> works in Sokoban. No digging either.</li>
<li>Going back downstairs costs <strong>-1 Luck each time</strong>. Solve each floor in one visit.</li>
<li>Using a scroll of earth in Sokoban also costs <strong>-1 Luck</strong>.</li>
<li>After solving a level, push leftover boulders into corners so they don’t block your path if you pass through again.</li>
</ul>
<p>The eight level maps and their solutions are too large to reproduce in full here, but the general approach for each floor:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Identify which variant you have</strong> by comparing the layout to known maps. The two variants for each floor are visually distinct.</li>
<li><strong>Work from the holes outward.</strong> Figure out which boulder needs to end up in each hole, then trace backward to find the push sequence.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t push boulders against walls</strong> unless that’s their final position. A boulder flush against a wall can only be pushed along the wall, never away from it.</li>
<li><strong>Clear the easy boulders first.</strong> Some boulders only need one or two pushes. Get those into position before tackling the complex sequences.</li>
</ol>
<p>The solutions are deterministic: for each variant, there is a known sequence of pushes that works every time. Experienced players memorize them. If you prefer to solve the puzzles yourself, the above tips are enough to get started. If you get stuck, the community has published step-by-step solutions for every variant.</p>

<h3 id="voluntary-challenges">Voluntary Challenges</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Dion Nicolaas cataloged the voluntary challenge conducts for RGRN, with contributions from Kate Nepveu, Raisse, Wim Benthem, Stephen Churchill, nyra, and Dylan O’Donnell.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once you’ve ascended a few times, you may find yourself looking for a harder challenge. NetHack tracks a set of <strong>conducts</strong>: voluntary restrictions that you can impose on yourself. At the end of a game, the final score screen lists which conducts you maintained. Nobody forces you to follow any of them. That’s what makes them interesting.</p>
<table>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>Some of these are straightforward variations on normal play (genocideless, artiwishless). Others fundamentally change how you approach the game:</p>
<p><strong>Foodless</strong> is brutal. You can’t eat, so you must survive entirely on prayer, rings of slow digestion, and careful nutrition management through other means. Every turn counts.</p>
<p><strong>Atheist</strong> removes prayer as a safety net. No emergency healing, no hunger rescue, no altar-based identification. You’re on your own with what the dungeon gives you.</p>
<p><strong>Pacifist</strong> means you can’t kill anything directly. Your pet can kill for you. Traps can kill for you. Boulders, conflict, and creative use of the environment can kill for you. But you personally cannot deal the killing blow. This turns the game into a puzzle of indirect violence.</p>
<p><strong>Illiterate</strong> is one of the hardest. No scrolls, no spellbooks, no engraving Elbereth (it contains letters). This eliminates most of the identification system, all scroll effects, and all spells.</p>
<p>Conducts can be combined. A vegan atheist pacifist ascension is possible. It has been done. Some players have ascended with all conducts simultaneously, which requires extraordinary knowledge of the game’s edge cases and a great deal of patience.</p>
<p>The conduct system is one of NetHack’s best features: it turns a single game into dozens of different games, each with its own constraints and discoveries.</p>

<h3 id="shopping-and-shopkeeper-pricing">Shopping and Shopkeeper Pricing</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Gregory Bond’s shopping guide (2001) was the first to document the deterministic pricing formulas that shopkeepers use. The price identification technique described here is based on his work.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shopkeepers are your primary source of gold-for-goods exchange, and also one of your best tools for identification. Their pricing is not random. It follows a formula, and if you understand the formula, you can figure out what an item is just by asking how much it costs.</p>
<h4 id="how-prices-work">How Prices Work</h4>
<p>Every item has a <strong>base price</strong> set by its type. When a shopkeeper quotes you a price, the base price has been modified by several factors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Charisma.</strong> High charisma gets discounts (up to 50% off at CHA 19+). Low charisma gets markups (up to double at CHA 5 or below).</li>
<li><strong>Unidentified markup.</strong> If you haven’t identified the item, 1 in 4 chance of a 33% markup on the buy price.</li>
<li><strong>Tourist tax.</strong> Tourists (or anyone wearing a Hawaiian shirt) pay 33% more.</li>
<li><strong>Anger surcharge.</strong> An angry shopkeeper charges 33% more.</li>
<li><strong>Enchantment.</strong> Weapons and armor gain 10gp per point of positive enchantment.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="using-prices-for-identification">Using Prices for Identification</h4>
<p>The key insight: even with the charisma modifier and random markup, you can often figure out the base price of an item by picking it up in a shop and noting the quoted price. Divide by your charisma modifier, account for the possible 33% markup, and you’ll land on a base price that narrows the item to one or two possibilities.</p>
<p>This is especially useful for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scrolls.</strong> Identify scrolls ($20) are the only scrolls at their price point. Any scroll quoted cheaply in a shop is almost certainly identify.</li>
<li><strong>Potions.</strong> The $50, $100, $150, $200, and $300 groups each contain a manageable number of potions. A price check splits a pile of unknown potions into small groups.</li>
<li><strong>Rings.</strong> The $100, $150, $200, and $300 groups are useful for narrowing rings.</li>
<li><strong>Wands.</strong> The $100, $150, $175, $200, and $500 groups work well. A $500 wand is either death or wishing.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="selling-and-credit">Selling and Credit</h4>
<p>When you sell items, you get roughly half the base price (1/3 for Tourists). Unidentified items may lose an additional 25%. The sell price is less useful for identification than the buy price, but it’s still a data point.</p>
<p>Shopkeepers extend credit. If you drop gold in a shop, it becomes credit. If you can’t afford an item, some shopkeepers will let you take it on credit (you’ll owe them). Leaving the shop without paying is theft, and the shopkeeper will attack.</p>
<h4 id="stealing">Stealing</h4>
<p>The most common method of acquiring expensive items for free is <strong>pet theft.</strong> If your pet picks up an item from the shop floor and carries it outside the shop doorway, you haven’t stolen it. The pet did. The shopkeeper doesn’t blame you. This takes patience (the pet has to wander onto the item, then wander out the door) but it costs nothing and angers nobody.</p>
<p>Other methods: teleporting out with merchandise, digging through the floor, or using a scroll of teleportation on the shopkeeper himself. These are all technically theft and will make the shopkeeper hostile. Pacifying an angry shopkeeper requires paying for everything you took.</p>

<h3 id="what-changed-since-last-time">What Changed Since Last Time</h3>
<p>If you’re an experienced traveler returning after some time away, the current edition of the Mazes includes several notable changes from the version you may remember. The most significant:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Themed rooms</strong> are now a regular feature of dungeon generation. You’ll encounter rooms with specific monster or item themes that didn’t exist before.</li>
<li><strong>Four new monster species</strong>: the displacer beast, genetic engineer, gold dragon, and baby gold dragon now roam the Mazes.</li>
<li><strong>The helm of caution</strong> is a new piece of armor.</li>
<li><strong>Mind flayers</strong> no longer cause amnesia (they still drain Intelligence, which can still kill you).</li>
<li><strong>Unicorn horns</strong> no longer restore lost attributes. This is a major change. In previous editions, the unicorn horn was a cure-all; now you’ll need other solutions.</li>
<li><strong>Gold dragon scale mail</strong> is a new addition. It acts as a light source when worn but provides no resistance property.</li>
<li><strong>Dragon scale mail</strong> properties are otherwise unchanged from previous editions (one extrinsic each).</li>
<li><strong>Bags of holding</strong> no longer destroy their contents on explosion. Items are scattered on the floor instead, which is bad but not catastrophic.</li>
<li><strong>Sacrifice</strong> for artifact generation now requires a minimum sacrifice value.</li>
<li><strong>Gehennom</strong> levels are more varied and interesting.</li>
<li><strong>Special levels</strong> can now generate mirrored (flipped), so don’t rely on fixed maps.</li>
<li><strong>Monsters</strong> can now use containers and unlock chests.</li>

<h3 id="a-brief-history-of-nethack">A Brief History of NetHack</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“The DevTeam thinks of everything.”</em> – Ancient proverb among NetHack players, usually uttered after discovering yet another obscure interaction that someone actually programmed on purpose.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>1987: Birth.</strong> NetHack was created by Mike Stephenson, who merged the codebase of Hack (by Jay Fenlason et al., itself derived from Rogue) with various modifications and improvements. The name “NetHack” came from the fact that development was coordinated over the Internet – still a novel concept in 1987. The original DevTeam members included Mike Stephenson, Izchak Miller, and Janet Walz.</p>
<p><strong>1987-1993: Rapid evolution.</strong> NetHack grew quickly through versions 1.0 to 3.1. Each release added entire subsystems: the quest, the endgame, Gehennom, pets, shops, altars, spellcasting, artifacts. By version 3.1, NetHack was recognizably the game it is today. The pace was fast. Version 3.0 came in 1989, 3.1 in 1993.</p>
<p><strong>1993-1996: The polishing era.</strong> Version 3.2 (1996) and its sub-releases refined and expanded the game. The Sokoban levels were added. More monsters, more items, more interactions. The DevTeam’s design philosophy became clear: every object should interact with every other object in some meaningful way. If you could think of it, they’d probably already coded it.</p>
<p><strong>1996-2003: The long golden age.</strong> Version 3.3 (1999) brought new races and roles. Version 3.4 (2002) and its bugfix 3.4.3 (2003) became the most played and most documented version of NetHack in history. The community thrived on RGRN (rec.games.roguelike.nethack), spoiler files multiplied, and ascension strategies were refined by thousands of players.</p>
<p><strong>2003-2015: The great silence.</strong> After 3.4.3, the DevTeam went quiet. For twelve years, no new release. The community continued playing 3.4.3, writing patches, creating variants (SporkHack, UnNetHack, NetHack4, dNetHack, FIQHack), and wondering if NetHack was finished. The DevTeam, famously secretive, said nothing.</p>
<p><strong>2015-2023: The return.</strong> In December 2015, the DevTeam surprised everyone with NetHack 3.6.0. Development continued through 3.6.1 (2018), 3.6.2 (2019), 3.6.6 (2020), and 3.6.7 (2023). Each release modernized the game while preserving its essential character.</p>
<p><strong>2023-present: The current era.</strong> NetHack 3.7 represents the latest evolution. The core game is intact – still 80x24 ASCII, still crushingly difficult, still deeper than any two-hundred-page guide can fully document. Forty years of continuous development by a team that thinks of everything.</p>
<p>The DevTeam remains semi-anonymous by tradition. Members have included Mike Stephenson, Izchak Miller (who passed away in 1994 and is honored in the game by a persistent gravestone), Janet Walz, Steve Linhart, Warwick Allison, Ken Arromdee, Jean-Christophe Collet, Kevin Darcy, Timo Hakulinen, Steve Creps, Kevin Smolkowski, Eric Smith, Dean Luick, Pat Rankin, and others. The current team continues to maintain and develop the game.</p>
<p>NetHack’s source code has always been freely available. It is one of the longest-running open source projects in existence, predating the term “open source” by a decade.</p>

<h3 id="famous-last-words">Famous Last Words</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Every dead adventurer has a story. Most of them end the same way.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A collection of epitaphs, gathered from tombstones, bones files, and the confessions of the overconfident. If you recognize yourself in any of these, you’re in good company.</p>
<ul>
<li>“Killed by a newt, while helpless.” – First turn. Last turn.</li>
<li>“Killed by a cockatrice corpse.” – Gloves. That’s all it takes.</li>
<li>“Choked on a tin of floating eye meat.” – Satiated means stop.</li>
<li>“Petrified by a chickatrice.” – They get you younger than you’d think.</li>
<li>“Killed by kicking a wall.” – The dungeon doesn’t forgive hubris.</li>
<li>“Killed by a poisoned dart trap.” – Poison resistance. Priority one.</li>
<li>“Killed by a falling rock trap.” – Helmets are functional, not fashionable.</li>
<li>“Died while praying.” – Your god was busy. Should have checked the timeout.</li>
<li>“Killed by a shopkeeper.” – They always had more HP than you. Always.</li>
<li>“Killed by a leocrotta.” – It said “Help! I’m being attacked!” It lied.</li>
<li>“Killed by touching a cockatrice corpse.” – Yes, even bare hands. Yes, even through a bag.</li>
<li>“Killed by a soldier ant.” – Not the worst monster. Just the worst surprise.</li>
<li>“Killed by contaminated water.” – The fountain gives. The fountain takes.</li>
<li>“Killed by a bolt of lightning.” – The wand was for them, not for you. Reflection exists.</li>
<li>“Killed by brainlessness.” – The mind flayer doesn’t negotiate.</li>
<li>“Killed by genocidal confusion.” – You genocided your own race. The scroll told you to read it while confused. Why did you listen?</li>
<li>“Ascended.” – Finally.</li>
</ul>
<p>The only epitaph that matters is the last one. Keep playing.</p>

<h3 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h3>
<p>NetHack has been played, cursed at, loved, and documented since 1987. The game itself is the work of the NetHack DevTeam, a loose collective of developers who have maintained one of the longest-running open source projects in existence. But the documentation, the strategy, the collected wisdom about how to actually survive the thing, that came from the players.</p>
<p>In the early days, knowledge spread through Usenet, specifically the newsgroup <strong>rec.games.roguelike.nethack</strong> (RGRN). Thousands of players posted questions, argued about strategy, and slowly assembled a shared body of knowledge about a game that refused to explain itself. This was before wikis, before Reddit, before Discord. If you wanted to know whether a cockatrice corpse could be wielded as a weapon, you searched the RGRN archives and hoped someone had asked before you. Someone usually had.</p>
<p>Out of those conversations came the first spoiler files: plain text documents that attempted to catalog every item, every monster, every interaction. They were written by hand, cross-referenced against the source code, and shared freely. They represented hundreds of hours of work by people who simply loved the game and wanted to help others play it.</p>
<p>This guide stands on their work. Specifically:</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Hugo</strong> compiled the first comprehensive spoiler set for NetHack 3.2.2, covering every item class, monster stat, spell formula, and score calculation in methodical detail. <strong>Dylan O’Donnell</strong> updated the entire set for 3.4.3, correcting, expanding, and maintaining the files over several years. Together, the Hugo/O’Donnell spoilers became the definitive reference: 38 files covering potions, scrolls, wands, rings, amulets, tools, weapons, armor, artifacts, food, monsters, spells, and more. The item data tables throughout Parts Four and Five of this guide are verified against their work. Published under BSD-like terms.</p>
<p><strong>Paul Waterman</strong> wrote the WCST NetHack Spoilers (originally the “World’s Encyclopaedia of NetHack”), a single sprawling document that covered the entire game in a conversational, opinionated voice. Where the Hugo/O’Donnell files were reference manuals, the WCST was a travel guide. It told you not just what things did but what to do about them. It was the original inspiration for the tone and structure of this guide, though no text has been copied from it. Published under CC-BY-NC-ND.</p>
<p><strong>Kate Nepveu</strong> maintained steelypips.org, the web archive that preserved the Hugo/O’Donnell spoilers, the RGRN community articles, and her own excellent guides (including the Elbereth FAQ cited in our traps chapter). Without Kate’s patient archival work, much of this material might have disappeared when Usenet faded.</p>
<p>The following <strong>RGRN community authors</strong> contributed articles, FAQs, and guides that informed specific sections of this guide:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>David Damerell</strong> wrote the Object Identification FAQ, the original systematic guide to figuring out what you’ve found without wasting scrolls of identify.</li>
<li><strong>Kieron Dunbar</strong> wrote the wand identification guide, laying out the engrave-test method that remains the fastest way to sort wands.</li>
<li><strong>Trevor Powell</strong> compiled the Instadeath Spoiler, the definitive catalog of ways to die in a single turn, cited in our Dangerous Encounters chapter.</li>
<li><strong>Arien Malec</strong> wrote the Medusa guide, collecting crossing strategies from dozens of RGRN posters and organizing them into a clear checklist.</li>
<li><strong>Matthew Lahut</strong> wrote the prayer guide that untangled the timeout and alignment systems.</li>
<li><strong>Boudewijn Waijers</strong> mapped solutions for all eight Sokoban level variants.</li>
<li><strong>Steven Bush</strong> calculated spellbook reading success rates.</li>
<li><strong>Gregory Bond</strong> documented shopkeeper pricing formulas.</li>
<li><strong>Dion Nicolaas</strong> cataloged the voluntary challenge conducts.</li>
<li><strong>David Goldfarb</strong> wrote the air elemental FAQ.</li>
<li><strong>Hojita Discordia</strong> documented experience value calculations.</li>
</ul>
<p>And many others: Ray Chason, Pat Rankin, Geoduck, Topi Linkala, Geoffrey Eadon, Roger Broadbent, Sebastian Haas, Jukka Lahtinen, and the countless anonymous posters on RGRN who asked “has anyone tried…” and then reported back.</p>
<p>This is what a community looks like over decades. People writing things down so that others don’t have to die the same stupid death. It’s generous, it’s nerdy, and it’s one of the best things about games.</p>
