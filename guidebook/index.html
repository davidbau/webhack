<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Recently, you have begun to find yourself unfulfilled and distant in
your daily occupation. Strange dreams of prospecting, stealing,
crusading, and combat have haunted you in your sleep for many months,
but you aren’t sure of the reason. You wonder whether you have in fact
been having those dreams all your life, and somehow managed to forget
about them until now. Some nights you awaken suddenly and cry out,
terrified at the vivid recollection of the strange and powerful
creatures that seem to be lurking behind every corner of the dungeon in
your dream. Could these details haunting your dreams be real? As each
night passes, you feel the desire to enter the mysterious caverns near
the ruins grow stronger. Each morning, however, you quickly put the idea
out of your head as you recall the tales of those who entered the
caverns before you and did not return. Eventually you can resist the
yearning to seek out the fantastic place in your dreams no longer. After
all, when other adventurers came back this way after spending time in
the caverns, they usually seemed better off than when they passed
through the first time. And who was to say that all of those who did not
return had not just kept going?</p>
<p>Asking around, you hear about a bauble, called the Amulet of Yendor
by some, which, if you can find it, will bring you great wealth. One
legend you were told even mentioned that the one who finds the amulet
will be granted immortality by the gods. The amulet is rumored to be
somewhere beyond the Valley of Gehennom, deep within the Mazes of
Menace. Upon hearing the legends, you immediately realize that there is
some profound and undiscovered reason that you are to descend into the
caverns and seek out that amulet of which they spoke. Even if the rumors
of the amulet’s powers are untrue, you decide that you should at least
be able to sell the tales of your adventures to the local minstrels for
a tidy sum, especially if you encounter any of the terrifying and
magical creatures of your dreams along the way. You spend one last night
fortifying yourself at the local inn, becoming more and more depressed
as you watch the odds of your success being posted on the inn’s walls
getting lower and lower.</p>
<p>In the morning you awake, collect your belongings, and set off for
the dungeon. After several days of uneventful travel, you see the
ancient ruins that mark the entrance to the Mazes of Menace. It is late
at night, so you make camp at the entrance and spend the night sleeping
under the open skies. In the morning, you gather your gear, eat what may
be your last meal outside, and enter the dungeon….</p>
</section>
<section id="what-is-going-on-here" class="level2">
<h2>2. What is going on here?</h2>
<p>You have just begun a game of NetHack. Your goal is to grab as much
treasure as you can, retrieve the Amulet of Yendor, and escape the Mazes
of Menace alive.</p>
<p>Your abilities and strengths for dealing with the hazards of
adventure will vary with your background and training:</p>
<p><em>Archeologists</em> understand dungeons pretty well; this enables
them to move quickly and sneak up on the local nasties. They start
equipped with the tools for a proper scientific expedition, and are able
to read ancient languages.</p>
<p><em>Barbarians</em> are warriors out of the hinterland, hardened to
battle. They begin their quests with naught but uncommon strength, a
trusty hauberk, and a great two-handed sword.</p>
<p><em>Cavemen</em> and <em>Cavewomen</em> start with exceptional
strength but, unfortunately, with neolithic weapons.</p>
<p><em>Healers</em> are wise in medicine and apothecary. They know the
herbs and simples that can restore vitality, ease pain, anesthetize, and
neutralize poisons; and with their instruments, they can divine a
being’s state of health or sickness. Their medical practice earns them
quite reasonable amounts of money, with which they enter the
dungeon.</p>
<p><em>Knights</em> are distinguished from the common skirmisher by
their devotion to the ideals of chivalry and by the surpassing
excellence of their armor.</p>
<p><em>Monks</em> are ascetics, who by rigorous practice of physical and
mental disciplines have become capable of fighting as effectively
without weapons as with. They wear no armor but make up for it with
increased mobility.</p>
<p><em>Priests</em> and <em>Priestesses</em> are clerics militant,
crusaders advancing the cause of righteousness with arms, armor, and
arts thaumaturgic. Their ability to commune with deities via prayer
occasionally extricates them from peril, but can also put them in
it.</p>
<p><em>Rangers</em> are most at home in the woods, and some say slightly
out of place in a dungeon. They are, however, experts in archery as well
as tracking and stealthy movement.</p>
<p><em>Rogues</em> are agile and stealthy thieves, with knowledge of
locks, traps, and poisons. Their advantage lies in surprise, which they
employ to great advantage.</p>
<p><em>Samurai</em> are the elite warriors of feudal Nippon. They are
lightly armored and quick, and wear the <em>dai-sho</em>, two swords of
the deadliest keenness.</p>
<p><em>Tourists</em> start out with lots of gold (suitable for shopping
with), a credit card, lots of food, some maps, and an expensive camera.
Most monsters don’t like being photographed.</p>
<p><em>Valkyries</em> are hardy warrior women. Their upbringing in the
harsh Northlands makes them strong, inures them to extremes of cold, and
instills in them stealth and cunning.</p>
<p><em>Wizards</em> start out with a knowledge of magic, a selection of
magical items, and a particular affinity for dweomercraft. Although
seemingly weak and easy to overcome at first sight, an experienced
Wizard is a deadly foe.</p>
<p>You may also choose the race of your character (within limits; most
roles have restrictions on which races are eligible for them):</p>
<p><em>Dwarves</em> are smaller than humans or elves, but are stocky and
solid individuals. Dwarves’ most notable trait is their great expertise
in mining and metalwork. Dwarvish armor is said to be second in quality
not even to the mithril armor of the Elves.</p>
<p><em>Elves</em> are agile, quick, and perceptive; very little of what
goes on will escape an Elf. The quality of Elven craftsmanship often
gives them an advantage in arms and armor.</p>
<p><em>Gnomes</em> are smaller than but generally similar to dwarves.
Gnomes are known to be expert miners, and it is known that a secret
underground mine complex built by this race exists within the Mazes of
Menace, filled with both riches and danger.</p>
<p><em>Humans</em> are by far the most common race of the surface world,
and are thus the norm to which other races are often compared. Although
they have no special abilities, they can succeed in any role.</p>
<p><em>Orcs</em> are a cruel and barbaric race that hate every living
thing (including other orcs). Above all others, Orcs hate Elves with a
passion unequalled, and will go out of their way to kill one at any
opportunity. The armor and weapons fashioned by the Orcs are typically
of inferior quality.</p>

<section id="what-do-all-those-things-on-the-screen-mean"
class="level2">
<h2>3. What do all those things on the screen mean?</h2>
<p>On the screen is kept a map of where you have been and what you have
seen on the current dungeon level; as you explore more of the level, it
appears on the screen in front of you.</p>
<p>When NetHack’s ancestor <em>rogue</em> first appeared, its screen
orientation was almost unique among computer fantasy games. Since then,
screen orientation has become the norm rather than the exception;
NetHack continues this fine tradition. Unlike text adventure games that
accept commands in pseudo-English sentences and explain the results in
words, NetHack commands are all one or two keystrokes and the results
are displayed graphically on the screen. A minimum screen size of 24
lines by 80 columns is recommended; if the screen is larger, only a
21x80 section will be used for the map.</p>
<p>NetHack can even be played by blind players, with the assistance of
Braille readers or speech synthesisers. Instructions for configuring
NetHack for the blind are included later in this document.</p>
<p>NetHack generates a new dungeon every time you play it; even the
authors still find it an entertaining and exciting game despite having
won several times.</p>
<p>NetHack offers a variety of display options. The options available to
you will vary from port to port, depending on the capabilities of your
hardware and software, and whether various compile-time options were
enabled when your executable was created. The three possible display
options are: a monochrome character interface, a color character
interface, and a graphical interface using small pictures called tiles.
The two character interfaces allow fonts with other characters to be
substituted, but the default assignments use standard ASCII characters
to represent everything. There is no difference between the various
display options with respect to game play. Because we cannot reproduce
the tiles or colors in the Guidebook, and because it is common to all
ports, we will use the default ASCII characters from the monochrome
character display when referring to things you might see on the screen
during your game.</p>
<p>In order to understand what is going on in NetHack, first you must
understand what NetHack is doing with the screen. The NetHack screen
replaces the “You see …” descriptions of text adventure games. Figure 1
is a sample of what a NetHack screen might look like. The way the screen
looks for you depends on your platform.</p>

<section id="the-status-lines-bottom" class="level3">
<h3>3.1. The status lines (bottom)</h3>
<p>The bottom two (or three) lines of the screen contain several cryptic
pieces of information describing your current status. Figure 1 shows the
traditional two-line status area below the map. Figure 2 shows just the
status area, when the <code>statuslines:3</code> option has been set
(not all interfaces support this option). If any status line becomes
wider than the screen, you might not see all of it due to truncation.
When the numbers grow bigger and multiple <em>conditions</em> are
present, the two-line format will run out of room on the second line,
but <code>statuslines:2</code> is the default because a basic 24-line
terminal isn’t tall enough for the third line.</p>
<p>Here are explanations of what the various status items mean:</p>
<p><code>Title</code> Your character’s name and professional ranking
(based on role and <em>experience level</em>, see below).</p>
<p><code>Strength</code> A measure of your character’s strength; one of
your six basic attributes. A human character’s attributes can range from
3 to 18 inclusive; non-humans may exceed these limits (occasionally you
may get super-strengths of the form 18/xx, and magic can also cause
attributes to exceed the normal limits). The higher your strength, the
stronger you are. Strength affects how successfully you perform physical
tasks, how much damage you do in combat, and how much loot you can
carry.</p>
<p><code>Dexterity</code> Dexterity affects your chances to hit in
combat, to avoid traps, and do other tasks requiring agility or
manipulation of objects.</p>
<p><code>Constitution</code> Constitution affects your ability to
recover from injuries and other strains on your stamina. When strength
is low or modest, constitution also affects how much you can carry. With
sufficiently high strength, the contribution to carrying capacity from
your constitution no longer matters.</p>
<p><code>Intelligence</code> Intelligence affects your ability to cast
spells and read spellbooks.</p>
<p><code>Wisdom</code> Wisdom comes from your practical experience
(especially when dealing with magic). It affects your magical
energy.</p>
<p><code>Charisma</code> Charisma affects how certain creatures react
toward you. In particular, it can affect the prices shopkeepers offer
you.</p>
<p><code>Alignment</code> <strong>Lawful</strong>,
<strong>Neutral</strong>, or <strong>Chaotic</strong>. Often, Lawful is
taken as good and Chaotic as evil, but legal and ethical do not always
coincide. Your alignment influences how other monsters react toward you.
Monsters of a like alignment are more likely to be non-aggressive, while
those of an opposing alignment are more likely to be seriously offended
at your presence.</p>
<p><code>Dungeon Level</code> How deep you are in the dungeon. You start
at level one and the number increases as you go deeper into the dungeon.
Some levels are special, and are identified by a name and not a number.
The Amulet of Yendor is reputed to be somewhere beneath the twentieth
level.</p>
<p><code>Gold</code> The number of gold pieces you are openly carrying.
Gold which you have concealed in containers is not counted.</p>
<p><code>Hit Points</code> Your current and maximum hit points. Hit
points indicate how much damage you can take before you die. The more
you get hit in a fight, the lower they get. You can regain hit points by
resting, or by using certain magical items or spells. The number in
parentheses is the maximum number your hit points can reach.</p>
<p><code>Power</code> Spell points. This tells you how much mystic
energy (<em>mana</em>) you have available for spell casting. Again,
resting will regenerate the amount available.</p>
<p><code>Armor Class</code> A measure of how effectively your armor
stops blows from unfriendly creatures. The lower this number is, the
more effective the armor; it is quite possible to have negative armor
class. See the <em>Armor</em> subsection of <em>Objects</em> for more
information.</p>
<p><code>Experience</code> Your current experience level. If the
<code>showexp</code> option is set, it will be followed by a slash and
experience points. As you adventure, you gain experience points. At
certain experience point totals, you gain an experience level. The more
experienced you are, the better you fight and withstand magical attacks.
(By the time your level reaches double digits, the usefulness of showing
the points with it has dropped significantly. You can use the
‘<code>O</code>’ command to turn <code>showexp</code> off to avoid using
up the limited status line space.)</p>
<p><code>Time</code> The number of turns elapsed so far, displayed if
you have the <code>time</code> option set.</p>
<p><code>Status</code> Hunger: your current hunger status. Values are
<strong>Satiated</strong>, <strong>Not Hungry</strong> (or
<strong>Normal</strong>), <strong>Hungry</strong>,
<strong>Weak</strong>, and <strong>Fainting</strong>. Not shown when
<strong>Normal</strong>. Encumbrance: an indication of how what you are
carrying affects your ability to move. Values are
<strong>Unencumbered</strong>, <strong>Burdened</strong>,
<strong>Stressed</strong>, <strong>Strained</strong>,
<strong>Overtaxed</strong>, and <strong>Overloaded</strong>. Not shown
when <strong>Unencumbered</strong>. Fatal conditions:
<strong>Stone</strong> (aka <strong>Petrifying</strong>, turning to
stone), <strong>Slime</strong> (turning into green slime),
<strong>Strngl</strong> (being strangled), <strong>FoodPois</strong>
(suffering from acute food poisoning), <strong>TermIll</strong>
(suffering from a terminal illness). Non-fatal conditions:
<strong>Blind</strong> (can’t see), <strong>Deaf</strong> (can’t hear),
<strong>Stun</strong> (stunned), <strong>Conf</strong> (confused),
<strong>Hallu</strong> (hallucinating). Movement modifiers:
<strong>Lev</strong> (levitating), <strong>Fly</strong> (flying),
<strong>Ride</strong> (riding). Other conditions and modifiers exist,
but there isn’t enough room to display them with the other status
fields.</p>
<p>The <code>#attributes</code> command (default key <code>^X</code>)
will show all current status information in unabbreviated format. It
also shows other information which might be included on the status lines
if those had more room.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-message-line-top" class="level3">
<h3>3.2. The message line (top)</h3>
<p>The top line of the screen is reserved for messages that describe
things that are impossible to represent visually. If you see a
<strong><code>--More--</code></strong> on the top line, this means that
NetHack has another message to display on the screen, but it wants to
make certain that you’ve read the one that is there first. To read the
next message, just press the space bar.</p>
<p>To change how and what messages are shown on the message line, see
“Configuring Message Types” and the <code>verbose</code> option.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-map-rest-of-the-screen" class="level3">
<h3>3.3. The map (rest of the screen)</h3>
<p>The rest of the screen is the map of the level as you have explored
it so far. Each symbol on the screen represents something. You can set
various graphics options to change some of the symbols the game uses;
otherwise, the game will use default symbols. Here is a list of what the
default symbols mean:</p>
<p><code>-</code> The horizontal or corner walls of a room, or an open
east/west door.</p>
<p><code>|</code> The vertical walls of a room, or an open north/south
door, or a grave.</p>
<p><code>.</code> The floor of a room, or ice, or a doorless doorway, or
the span of an open drawbridge.</p>
<p><code>#</code> A corridor, or iron bars, or a tree, or the portcullis
of a closed drawbridge. Note: engravings in corridors also appear as
<code>#</code> but are shown in a different color from normal corridor
locations.</p>
<p><code>&gt;</code> Stairs down: a way to the next level.</p>
<p><code>&lt;</code> Stairs up: a way to the previous level.</p>
<p><code>+</code> A closed door, or a spellbook containing a spell you
may be able to learn.</p>
<p><code>@</code> Your character or a human or an elf.</p>
<p><code>$</code> A pile of gold.</p>
<p><code>^</code> A trap (once you have detected it).</p>
<p><code>)</code> A weapon.</p>
<p><code>[</code> A suit or piece of armor.</p>
<p><code>%</code> Something edible (not necessarily healthy).</p>
<p><code>?</code> A scroll.</p>
<p><code>/</code> A wand.</p>
<p><code>=</code> A ring.</p>
<p><code>!</code> A potion.</p>
<p><code>(</code> A useful item (pick-axe, key, lamp…).</p>
<p><code>"</code> An amulet or a spider web.</p>
<p><code>*</code> A gem or rock (possibly valuable, possibly
worthless).</p>
<p><code>`</code> A boulder or statue or an engraving on the floor of a
room. Note: statues are displayed as if they were the monsters they
depict so won’t appear as a <em>grave accent</em> (aka
<em>back-tick</em>).</p>
<p><code>0</code> An iron ball.</p>
<p><code>_</code> An altar, or an iron chain.</p>
<p><code>{</code> A fountain or a sink.</p>
<p><code>}</code> A pool of water or moat or a wall of water or a pool
of lava or a wall of lava.</p>
<p><code>\</code> An opulent throne.</p>
<p><code>a-z</code>  <em>and</em> <code>A-H</code>
<code>J-Z</code>  <em>and</em> <code>@&amp;':;</code> Letters and
certain other symbols represent the various inhabitants of the Mazes of
Menace. Watch out, they can be nasty and vicious. Sometimes, however,
they can be helpful.</p>
<p><code>I</code> Rather than a specific type of monster, this marks the
last known location of an invisible or otherwise unseen monster. Note
that the monster could have moved. The <code>s</code>, <code>F</code>,
and <code>m</code> commands may be useful here.</p>
<p><code>1-5</code> The digits 1 through 5 may be displayed, marking
unseen monsters sensed via the <em>Warning</em> attribute. Less
dangerous monsters are indicated by lower values, more dangerous by
higher values.</p>
<p>You need not memorize all these symbols; you can ask the game what
any symbol represents with the <code>/</code> command (see the next
section for more info).</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="commands" class="level2">
<h2>4. Commands</h2>
<p>Commands can be initiated by typing one or two characters to which
the command is bound to, or typing the command name in the extended
commands entry. Some commands, like <code>search</code>, do not require
that any more information be collected by NetHack. Other commands might
require additional information, for example a direction, or an object to
be used. For those commands that require additional information, NetHack
will present you with either a menu of choices or with a command line
prompt requesting information. Which you are presented with will depend
chiefly on how you have set the <code>menustyle</code> option.</p>
<p>For example, a common question, in the form “What do you want to
use? [a-zA-Z ?*]”, asks you to choose an object you are carrying. Here,
<code>a-zA-Z</code> are the inventory letters of your possible choices.
Typing <code>?</code> gives you an inventory list of these items, so you
can see what each letter refers to. In this example, there is also a
<code>*</code> indicating that you may choose an object not on the list,
if you wanted to use something unexpected. Typing a <code>*</code> lists
your entire inventory, so you can see the inventory letters of every
object you’re carrying. Finally, if you change your mind and decide you
don’t want to do this command after all, you can press the ESC key to
abort the command.</p>
<p>You can put a number before some commands to repeat them that many
times; for example, <code>10s</code> will search ten times. If you have
the <code>number_pad</code> option set, you must type <code>n</code> to
prefix a count, so the example above would be typed <code>n10s</code>
instead. Commands for which counts make no sense ignore them. In
addition, movement commands can be prefixed for greater control (see
below). To cancel a count or a prefix, press the ESC key.</p>
<p>The list of commands is rather long, but it can be read at any time
during the game through the <code>?</code> command, which accesses a
menu of helpful texts. Here are the default key bindings for your
reference:</p>
<p><code>?</code> Help menu: display one of several help texts
available.</p>
<p><code>/</code> The <code>whatis</code> command, to tell what a symbol
represents. You may choose to specify a location or type a symbol (or
even a whole word) to explain. Specifying a location is done by moving
the cursor to a particular spot on the map and then pressing one of
<code>.</code>, <code>,</code>, <code>;</code>, or <code>:</code>.
<code>.</code> will explain the symbol at the chosen location,
conditionally check for <code>More info?</code> depending upon whether
the <code>help</code> option is on, and then you will be asked to pick
another location; <code>,</code> will explain the symbol but skip any
additional information, then let you pick another location;
<code>;</code> will skip additional info and also not bother asking you
to choose another location to examine; <code>:</code> will show
additional info, if any, without asking for confirmation. When picking a
location, pressing the ESC key will terminate this command, or pressing
<code>?</code> will give a brief reminder about how it works. If the
<code>autodescribe</code> option is on, a short description of what you
see at each location is shown as you move the cursor. Typing
<code>#</code> while picking a location will toggle that option on or
off. The <code>whatis_coord</code> option controls whether the short
description includes map coordinates. Specifying a name rather than a
location always gives any additional information available about that
name. You may also request a description of nearby monsters, all
monsters currently displayed, nearby objects, or all objects. The
<code>whatis_coord</code> option controls which format of map coordinate
is included with their descriptions.</p>
<p><code>&amp;</code> Tell what a command does.</p>
<p><code>&lt;</code> Go up to the previous level (if you are on a
staircase or ladder).</p>
<p><code>&gt;</code> Go down to the next level (if you are on a
staircase or ladder).</p>
<p><code>[yuhjklbn]</code> Go one step in the direction indicated (see
Figure 3). If you sense or remember a monster there, you will fight the
monster instead. Only these one-step movement commands cause you to
fight monsters; the others (below) are <code>safe.</code></p>
<pre><code>    y  k  u            7  8  9    
     \ | /              \ | /     
    h- . -l            4- . -6    
     / | \              / | \     
    b  j  n            1  2  3    
(number_pad off)   (number_pad on)</code></pre>
<div style="text-align:center">
Figure 3
</div>
<p><code>[YUHJKLBN]</code> Go in that direction until you hit a wall or
run into something.</p>
<p><code>m[yuhjklbn]</code> Prefix: move without picking up objects or
fighting (even if you remember a monster there). A few non-movement
commands use the ‘<code>m</code>’ prefix to request operating via menu
(to temporarily override the <code>menustyle :traditional</code>
option). Primarily useful for ‘<code>,</code>’ (pickup) when there is
only one class of objects present (where there won’t be any “what kinds
of objects?” prompt, so no opportunity to answer <code>m</code> at that
prompt). The prefix will make <code>#travel</code> command show a menu
of interesting targets in sight. It can also be used with the
‘<code>\</code>’ (known, show a list of all discovered objects) and the
‘<code>`</code>’ (knownclass, show a list of discovered objects in a
particular class) commands to offer a menu of several sorting
alternatives (which sets a new value for the
<code>sortdiscoveries</code> option); also for <code>#vanquished</code>
and <code>#genocided</code> commands to offer a sorting menu. A few
other commands (eat food, offer sacrifice, apply tinning-kit,
drink/quaff, dip, tip container) use the ‘<code>m</code>’ prefix to skip
checking for applicable objects on the floor and go straight to checking
inventory, or (for <code>#loot</code> to remove a saddle), skip
containers and go straight to adjacent monsters. In debug mode (aka
<code>wizard mode</code>), the <code>m</code> prefix may also be used
with the <code>#teleport</code> and <code>#wizlevelport</code>
commands.</p>
<p><code>F[yuhjklbn]</code> Prefix: fight a monster (even if you only
guess one is there).</p>
<p><code>g[yuhjklbn]</code> Prefix: move until something interesting is
found.</p>
<p><code>G[yuhjklbn]</code> or <code>&lt;Control&gt;+[yuhjklbn]</code>
Prefix: similar to <code>g</code>, but forking of corridors is not
considered interesting. Note:
<code>&lt;Control&gt;</code>+<code>&lt;key&gt;</code> means holding the
<code>&lt;Control&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;Ctrl&gt;</code> key down like
<code>&lt;Shift&gt;</code> while typing and releasing
<code>&lt;key&gt;</code>, then releasing <code>&lt;Control&gt;</code>.
^<code>&lt;key&gt;</code> is used as shorthand elsewhere in the
Guidebook to mean the same thing. Control characters are
case-insensitive so ^x and ^X are the same.</p>
<p><code>M[yuhjklbn]</code> Old versions supported ‘<code>M</code>’ as a
movement prefix which combined the effect of ‘<code>m</code>’ with
<code>&lt;Control&gt;</code>+<code>&lt;direction&gt;</code>. That is no
longer supported as a prefix but similar effect can be achieved by using
‘<code>m</code>’ and <code>G</code> <code>&lt;direction&gt;</code> in
combination. <code>m</code> can also be used in combination with
<code>g</code> <code>&lt;direction&gt;</code>,
<code>&lt;Control&gt;</code>+<code>&lt;direction&gt;</code>, or
<code>&lt;Shift&gt;</code>+<code>&lt;direction&gt;</code>.</p>
<p><code>_</code> Travel to a map location via a shortest-path
algorithm. The shortest path is computed over map locations the hero
knows about (e.g. seen or previously traversed). If there is no known
path, a guess is made instead. Stops on most of the same conditions as
the ‘<code>G</code>’ prefix, but without picking up objects, so
implicitly forces the ‘<code>m</code>’ prefix. For ports with mouse
support, the command is also invoked when a mouse-click takes place on a
location other than the current position.</p>
<p><code>.</code> Wait or rest, do nothing for one turn. Precede with
the <code>m</code> prefix to wait for a turn even next to a hostile
monster, if <code>safe_wait</code> is on.</p>
<p><code>a</code> Apply (use) a tool (pick-axe, key, lamp…). If used on
a wand, that wand will be broken, releasing its magic in the process.
Confirmation is required.</p>
<p><code>A</code> Remove one or more worn items, such as armor. Use
<code>T</code> (take off) to take off only one piece of armor or
<code>R</code> (remove) to take off only one accessory.</p>
<p><code>^A</code> Repeat the previous command.</p>
<p><code>c</code> Close a door.</p>
<p><code>C</code> Call (name) a monster, an individual object, or a type
of object. Same as extended command <code>#name</code>.</p>
<p><code>^C</code> Panic button. Quit the game.</p>
<p><code>d</code> Drop something. For example <code>d7a</code> means
drop seven items of object <em>a</em>.</p>
<p><code>D</code> Drop several things. In answer to the question
<code>What kinds of things do you want to drop? [!%= BUCXPaium]</code>
you should type zero or more object symbols possibly followed by
<code>a</code> and/or <code>i</code> and/or <code>u</code> and/or
<code>m</code>. In addition, one or more of the blessed/uncursed/cursed
groups may be typed.</p>

<p>The last example shows a combination. There are four categories of
object filtering: class (<code>!</code> for potions, <code>?</code> for
scrolls, and so on), shop status (<code>u</code> for unpaid, in other
words, owned by the shop), bless/curse state (<code>B</code>,
<code>U</code>, <code>C</code>, and <code>X</code> as shown above), and
novelty (<code>P</code>, recently picked up items; controlled by picking
up or dropping things rather than by any time factor). If you specify
more than one value in a category (such as <code>!?</code> for potions
and scrolls or <code>BU</code> for blessed and uncursed), an inventory
object will meet the criteria if it matches any of the specified values
(so <code>!?</code> means <code>!</code> or <code>?</code>). If you
specify more than one category, an inventory object must meet each of
the category criteria (so <code>%u</code> means class <code>%</code> and
unpaid <code>u</code>). Lastly, you may specify multiple values within
multiple categories: <code>!?BU</code> will select all potions and
scrolls which are known to be blessed or uncursed. (In versions prior to
3.6, filter combinations behaved differently.)</p>
<p><code>^D</code> Kick something (usually a door).</p>
<p><code>e</code> Eat food. Normally checks for edible item(s) on the
floor, then if none are found or none are chosen, checks for edible
item(s) in inventory. Precede <code>e</code> with the <code>m</code>
prefix to bypass attempting to eat anything off the floor. If you
attempt to eat while already satiated, you might choke to death. If you
risk it, you will be asked whether to “continue eating?” <em>if you
survive the first bite</em>. You can set the
<code>paranoid_confirmation:eating</code> option to require a response
of <code>yes</code> instead of just <code>y</code>.</p>
<p><code>E</code> Engrave a message on the floor. E- - write in the dust
with your fingers.</p>
<p>Engraving the word <code>Elbereth</code> will cause most monsters to
not attack you hand-to-hand (but if you attack, you will rub it out);
this is often useful to give yourself a breather.</p>
<p><code>f</code> Fire (shoot or throw) one of the objects placed in
your quiver (or quiver sack, or that you have at the ready). You may
select ammunition with a previous <code>Q</code> command, or let the
computer pick something appropriate if <code>autoquiver</code> is true.
If your wielded weapon has the throw-and-return property, your quiver is
empty, and <code>autoquiver</code> is false, you will throw that wielded
weapon instead of filling the quiver. This will also automatically use a
polearm if wielded. If <code>fireassist</code> is true, firing will
automatically try to wield a launcher (for example, a bow or a sling)
matching the ammo in the quiver; this might take multiple turns, and get
interrupted by a monster. Remember to swap back to your main melee
weapon afterwards. See also <code>t</code> (throw) for more general
throwing and shooting.</p>
<p><code>i</code> List your inventory (everything you’re carrying).</p>
<p><code>I</code> List selected parts of your inventory, usually be
specifying the character for a particular set of objects, like
<code>[</code> for armor or <code>!</code> for potions.</p>

</table>
<p><code>o</code> Open a door.</p>
<p><code>O</code> Set options. A menu showing the current option values
will be displayed. You can change most values simply by selecting the
menu entry for the given option (ie, by typing its letter or clicking
upon it, depending on your user interface). For the non-boolean choices,
a further menu or prompt will appear once you’ve closed this menu. The
available options are listed later in this Guidebook. Options are
usually set before the game rather than with the <code>O</code> command;
see the section on options below. Precede <code>O</code> with the
<code>m</code> prefix to show advanced options.</p>
<p><code>^O</code> Show overview. Shortcut for <code>#overview</code>:
list interesting dungeon levels visited. (Prior to 3.6.0,
<code>^O</code> was a debug mode command which listed the placement of
all special levels. Use <code>#wizwhere</code> to run that command.)</p>
<p><code>p</code> Pay your shopping bill.</p>
<p><code>P</code> Put on an accessory (ring, amulet, or blindfold). This
command may also be used to wear armor. The prompt for which inventory
item to use will only list accessories, but choosing an unlisted item of
armor will attempt to wear it. (See the <code>W</code> command below. It
lists armor as the inventory choices but will accept an accessory and
attempt to put that on.)</p>
<p><code>^P</code> Repeat previous message. Subsequent <code>^P</code>s
repeat earlier messages. For some interfaces, the behavior can be varied
via the <code>msg_window</code> option.</p>
<p><code>q</code> Quaff (drink) something (potion, water, etc). When
there is a fountain or sink present, it asks whether to drink from that.
If that is declined, then it offers a chance to choose a potion from
inventory. Precede <code>q</code> with the <code>m</code> prefix to skip
asking about drinking from a fountain or sink.</p>
<p><code>Q</code> Select an object for your quiver, quiver sack, or just
generally at the ready (only one of these is available at a time). You
can then throw this (or one of these) using the <code>f</code>
command.</p>
<p><code>r</code> Read a scroll or spellbook.</p>
<p><code>R</code> Remove a worn accessory (ring, amulet, or blindfold).
If you’re wearing more than one, you’ll be prompted for which one to
remove. When you’re only wearing one, then by default it will be removed
without asking, but you can set the
<code>paranoid_confirmation:Remove</code> option to require a prompt.
This command may also be used to take off armor. The prompt for which
inventory item to remove only lists worn accessories, but an item of
worn armor can be chosen. (See the <code>T</code> command below. It
lists armor as the inventory choices but will accept an accessory and
attempt to remove it.)</p>
<p><code>^R</code> Redraw the screen.</p>
<p><code>s</code> Search for secret doors and traps around you. It
usually takes several tries to find something. Precede with the
<code>m</code> prefix to search for a turn even next to a hostile
monster, if <code>safe_wait</code> is on. Can also be used to figure out
whether there is still a monster at an adjacent “remembered, unseen
monster” marker.</p>
<p><code>S</code> Save the game (which suspends play and exits the
program). The saved game will be restored automatically the next time
you play using the same character name. In normal play, once a saved
game is restored the file used to hold the saved data is deleted. In
explore mode, once restoration is accomplished you are asked whether to
keep or delete the file. Keeping the file makes it feasible to play for
a while then quit without saving and later restore again. There is no
“save current game state and keep playing” command, not even in explore
mode where saved game files can be kept and re-used.</p>
<p><code>t</code> Throw an object or shoot a projectile. There’s no
separate <code>shoot</code> command. If you throw an arrow while
wielding a bow, you are shooting that arrow and any weapon skill bonus
or penalty for bow applies. If you throw an arrow while not wielding a
bow, you are throwing it by hand and it will generally be less effective
than when shot. See also <code>f</code> (fire) for throwing or shooting
an item pre-selected via the <code>Q</code> (quiver) command, with some
extra assistance.</p>
<p><code>T</code> Take off armor. If you’re wearing more than one piece,
you’ll be prompted for which one to take off. (Note that this treats a
cloak covering a suit and/or a shirt, or a suit covering a shirt, as if
the underlying items weren’t there.) When you’re only wearing one, then
by default it will be taken off without asking, but you can set the
<code>paranoid_confirmation:Remove</code> option to require a prompt.
This command may also be used to remove accessories. The prompt for
which inventory item to take off only lists worn armor, but a worn
accessory can be chosen. (See the <code>R</code> command above. It lists
accessories as the inventory choices but will accept an item of armor
and attempt to take it off.)</p>
<p><code>^T</code> Teleport, if you have the ability.</p>
<p><code>v</code> Display version number.</p>
<p><code>V</code> Display the game history.</p>
<p><code>w</code> Wield weapon. w- - wield nothing, use your bare (or
gloved) hands.</p>
<p>Some characters can wield two weapons at once; use the <code>X</code>
command (or the <code>#twoweapon</code> extended command) to do so.</p>
<p><code>W</code> Wear armor. This command may also be used to put on an
accessory (ring, amulet, or blindfold). The prompt for which inventory
item to use will only list armor, but choosing an unlisted accessory
will attempt to put it on. (See the <code>P</code> command above. It
lists accessories as the inventory choices but will accept an item of
armor and attempt to wear it.)</p>
<p><code>x</code> Exchange your wielded weapon with the item in your
alternate weapon slot. The latter is used as your secondary weapon when
engaging in two-weapon combat. Note that if one of these slots is empty,
the exchange still takes place.</p>
<p><code>X</code> Toggle two-weapon combat, if your character can do it.
Also available via the <code>#twoweapon</code> extended command. (In
versions prior to 3.6 this keystroke ran the command to switch from
normal play to <code>explore mode</code>, also known as
<code>discovery mode</code>, which has now been moved to
<code>#exploremode</code> and M-X.)</p>
<p><code>^X</code> Display basic information about your character.
Displays name, role, race, gender (unless role name makes that
redundant, such as <em>Caveman</em> or <em>Priestess</em>), and
alignment, along with your patron deity and his or her opposition. It
also shows most of the various items of information from the status
line(s) in a less terse form, including several additional things which
don’t appear in the normal status display due to space considerations.
In normal play, that’s all that <code>^X</code> displays. In explore
mode, the role and status feedback is augmented by the information
provided by <em>enlightenment</em> magic.</p>
<p><code>z</code> Zap a wand. z. - to aim at yourself, use
<code>\.</code> for the direction.</p>
<p><code>Z</code> Zap (cast) a spell. Z. - to cast at yourself, use
<code>\.</code> for the direction.</p>
<p><code>^Z</code> Suspend the game UNIX” versions with job control
only).” ( See <code>#suspend</code> below for more details.</p>
<p><code>:</code> Look at what is here.</p>
<p><code>;</code> Show what type of thing a visible symbol corresponds
to.</p>
<p><code>,</code> Pick up some things from the floor beneath you. May be
preceded by <code>m</code> to force a selection menu.</p>
<p><code>@</code> Toggle the <code>autopickup</code> option on and
off.</p>
<p><code>^</code> Ask for the type of an adjacent trap you found
earlier.</p>
<p><code>)</code> Tell what weapon you are wielding.</p>
<p><code>[</code> Tell what armor you are wearing.</p>
<p><code>=</code> Tell what rings you are wearing.</p>
<p><code>"</code> Tell what amulet you are wearing.</p>
<p><code>(</code> Tell what tools you are using.</p>
<p><code>*</code> Tell what equipment you are using. Combines the
preceding five type-specific commands into one.</p>
<p><code>$</code> Report the gold you’re carrying, possibly shop credit
and/or debt too.</p>
<p><code>+</code> List the spells you know. Using this command, you can
also rearrange the order in which your spells are listed, either by
sorting the entire list or by picking one spell from the menu then
picking another to swap places with it. Swapping pairs of spells changes
their casting letters, so the change lasts after the current
<code>+</code> command finishes. Sorting the whole list is temporary. To
make the most recent sort order persist beyond the current
<code>+</code> command, choose the sort option again and then pick
“reassign casting letters”. (Any spells learned after that will be added
to the end of the list rather than be inserted into the sorted
ordering.)</p>
<p><code>\</code> Show what types of objects have been discovered. May
be preceded by ‘<code>m</code>’ to select preferred display order.</p>
<p><code>`</code> Show discovered types for one class of objects. May be
preceded by ‘<code>m</code>’ to select preferred display order.</p>
<p><code>|</code> If persistent inventory display is supported and
enabled (with the <code>perm_invent</code> option), interact with it
instead of with the map. Allows scrolling with the menu_first_page,
menu_previous_page, menu_next_page, and menu_last_page keys
(‘<code>^</code>’, ‘<code>&lt;</code>’, ‘<code>&gt;</code>’,
‘<code>|</code>’ by default). Some interfaces also support
menu_shift_left and menu_shift_right keys (‘<code>{</code>’ and
‘<code>}</code>’ by default). Use the <em>Return</em> (aka
<em>Enter</em>) or <em>Escape</em> key to resume play.</p>
<p><code>!</code> Escape to a shell. See <code>#shell</code> below for
more details.</p>
<p><code>Del</code> Show map without obstructions. You can view the
explored portion of the current level’s map without monsters; without
monsters and objects; or without monsters, objects, and traps. The
<code>&lt;del&gt;</code> key is also shown as
<code>&lt;delete&gt;</code> on some keyboards or
<code>&lt;rubout&gt;</code> on others. It is sometimes displayed as ^?
even though that is not an actual control character. Many terminals have
an option to swap the <code>&lt;delete&gt;</code> and
<code>&lt;backspace&gt;</code> keys, so typing the
<code>&lt;del&gt;</code> key might not execute this command. If that
happens, you can use the extended command <code>#terrain</code>
instead.</p>
<p><code>#</code> Perform an extended command.</p>
<p>As you can see, the authors of NetHack used up all the letters, so
this is a way to introduce the less frequently used commands. What
extended commands are available depends on what features the game was
compiled with.</p>
<p><code>#adjust</code> Adjust inventory letters (most useful when the
<code>fixinv</code> option is <code>on</code>). Autocompletes. Default
key is <code>M-a</code>. This command allows you to move an item from
one particular inventory slot to another so that it has a letter which
is more meaningful for you or that it will appear in a particular
location when inventory listings are displayed. You can move to a
currently empty slot, or if the destination is occupied—and won’t
merge—the item there will swap slots with the one being moved.
<code>#adjust</code> can also be used to split a stack of objects; when
choosing the item to adjust, enter a count prior to its letter.
Adjusting without a count used to collect all compatible stacks when
moving to the destination. That behavior has been changed; to gather
compatible stacks, <code>#adjust</code> a stack into its own inventory
slot. If it has a name assigned, other stacks with the same name or with
no name will merge provided that all their other attributes match. If it
does not have a name, only other stacks with no name are eligible. In
either case, otherwise compatible stacks with a different name will not
be merged. This contrasts with using <code>#adjust</code> to move from
one slot to a different slot. In that situation, moving (no count given)
a compatible stack will merge if either stack has a name when the other
doesn’t and give that name to the result, while splitting (count given)
will ignore the source stack’s name when deciding whether to merge with
the destination stack.</p>
<p><code>#annotate</code> Allows you to specify one line of text to
associate with the current dungeon level. All levels with annotations
are displayed by the <code>#overview</code> command. Autocompletes.
Default key is <code>M-A</code>, and also <code>^N</code> if
<code>number_pad</code> is on.</p>
<p><code>#apply</code> Apply (use) a tool such as a pick-axe, a key, or
a lamp. Default key is <code>a</code>. If the tool used acts on items on
the floor, using the <code>m</code> prefix skips those items. If used on
a wand, that wand will be broken, releasing its magic in the process.
Confirmation is required.</p>
<p><code>#attributes</code> Show your attributes. Default key is
<code>^X</code>.</p>
<p><code>#autopickup</code> Toggle the <code>autopickup</code> option
on/off. Default key is <code>@</code>.</p>
<p><code>#bugreport</code> Bring up a browser window to submit a report
to the NetHack Development Team. Can be disabled at the time the program
is built; when enabled, CRASHREPORTURL must be set in the system
configuration file.</p>
<p><code>#call</code> Call (name) a monster, or an object in inventory,
on the floor, or in the discoveries list, or add an annotation for the
current level (same as <code>#annotate</code>). Default key is
<code>C</code>.</p>
<p><code>#cast</code> Cast a spell. Default key is <code>Z</code>.</p>
<p><code>#chat</code> Talk to someone. Default key is
<code>M-c</code>.</p>
<p><code>#chronicle</code> Show a list of important game events.</p>
<p><code>#close</code> Close a door. Default key is <code>c</code>.</p>
<p><code>#conduct</code> List voluntary challenges you have maintained.
Autocompletes. Default key is <code>M-C</code>. See the section below
entitled <code>Conduct</code> for details.</p>
<p><code>#debugfuzzer</code> Start the fuzz tester. Debug mode only.</p>
<p><code>#dip</code> Dip an object into something. Autocompletes.
Default key is <code>M-d</code>. The <code>m</code> prefix skips dipping
into a fountain or pool if there is one at your location.</p>
<p><code>#down</code> Go down a staircase. Default key is
<code>&gt;</code>.</p>
<p><code>#drop</code> Drop an item. Default key is <code>d</code>.</p>
<p><code>#droptype</code> Drop specific item types. Default key is
<code>D</code>.</p>
<p><code>#eat</code> Eat something. Default key is <code>e</code>. The
<code>m</code> prefix skips eating items on the floor.</p>
<p><code>#engrave</code> Engrave writing on the floor. Default key is
<code>E</code>.</p>
<p><code>#enhance</code> Advance or check weapon and spell skills.
Autocompletes. Default key is <code>M-e</code>.</p>
<p><code>#exploremode</code> Switch from normal play to non-scoring
explore mode. Default key is <code>M-X</code>. Requires confirmation;
default response is <code>n</code> (no). To really switch to explore
mode, respond with <code>y</code>. You can set the
<code>paranoid_confirmation:quit</code> option to require a response of
<code>yes</code> instead.</p>
<p><code>#fight</code> Prefix key to force fight a direction, even if
you see nothing to fight there. Default key is <code>F</code>, or
<code>-</code> with <code>number_pad</code></p>
<p><code>#fire</code> Fire ammunition from quiver, possibly autowielding
a launcher, or hit with a wielded polearm. Default key is
<code>f</code>.</p>
<p><code>#force</code> Force a lock. Autocompletes. Default key is
<code>M-f</code>.</p>
<p><code>#genocided</code> List any monster types which have been
genocided. In explore mode and debug mode it also shows types which have
become extinct. The display order is the same as is used by #vanquished.
The <code>m</code> prefix brings up a menu of available sorting orders,
and doing that for either #genocided or #vanquished changes the order
for both. If the sorting order is “count high to low” or “count low to
high” (which are applicable for #vanquished), that will be ignored for
#genocided and alphabetical will be used instead. The menu omits those
two choices when used for #genocide. Autocompletes. Default key is
<code>M-g</code>.</p>
<p><code>#glance</code> Show what type of thing a map symbol corresponds
to. Default key is <code>;</code>.</p>
<p><code>#help</code> Show the help menu. Default key is <code>?</code>,
and also <code>h</code> if <code>number_pad</code> is on.</p>
<p><code>#herecmdmenu</code> Show a menu of possible actions directed at
your current location. The menu is limited to a subset of the likeliest
actions, not an exhaustive set of all possibilities. Autocompletes. If
mouse support is enabled and the <code>herecmd_menu</code> option is On,
clicking on the hero (or steed when mounted) will execute this
command.</p>
<p><code>#history</code> Show long version and game history. Default key
is <code>V</code>.</p>
<p><code>#inventory</code> Show your inventory. Default key is
<code>i</code>.</p>
<p><code>#inventtype</code> Inventory specific item types. Default key
is <code>I</code>.</p>
<p><code>#invoke</code> Invoke an object’s special powers.
Autocompletes. Default key is <code>M-i</code>.</p>
<p><code>#jump</code> Jump to another location. Autocompletes. Default
key is <code>M-j</code>, and also <code>j</code> if
<code>number_pad</code> is on.</p>
<p><code>#kick</code> Kick something. Default key is <code>^D</code>,
and <code>k</code> if <code>number_pad</code> is on.</p>
<p><code>#known</code> Show what object types have been discovered.
Default key is ‘<code>\</code>’. The ‘<code>m</code>’ prefix allows
assigning a new value to the <code>sortdiscoveries</code> option to
control the order in which the discoveries are displayed.</p>
<p><code>#knownclass</code> Show discovered types for one class of
objects. Default key is ‘<code>`</code>’. The ‘<code>m</code>’ prefix
operates the same as for <code>#known</code>.</p>
<p><code>#levelchange</code> Change your experience level.
Autocompletes. Debug mode only.</p>
<p><code>#lightsources</code> Show mobile light sources. Autocompletes.
Debug mode only.</p>
<p><code>#look</code> Look at what is here, under you. Default key is
<code>:</code>.</p>
<p><code>#lookaround</code> Describe what you can see, or remember, of
your surroundings.</p>
<p><code>#loot</code> Loot a box or bag on the floor beneath you, or the
saddle from a steed standing next to you. Autocompletes. Precede with
the <code>m</code> prefix to skip containers at your location and go
directly to removing a saddle. Default key is <code>M-l</code>, and also
<code>l</code> if <code>number_pad</code> is on.</p>
<p><code>#monster</code> Use a monster’s special ability (when
polymorphed into monster form). Autocompletes. Default key is
<code>M-m</code>.</p>
<p><code>#name</code> Name a monster, an individual object, or a type of
object. Same as <code>#call</code>. Autocompletes. Default keys are
<code>N</code>, <code>M-n</code>, and <code>M-N</code>.</p>
<p><code>#offer</code> Offer a sacrifice to the gods. Autocompletes.
Default key is <code>M-o</code>. You’ll need to find an altar to have
any chance at success. Corpses of recently killed monsters are the
fodder of choice. The <code>m</code> prefix skips offering any items
which are on the altar.</p>
<p><code>#open</code> Open a door. Default key is <code>o</code>.</p>
<p><code>#options</code> Show and change option settings. Default key is
<code>O</code>. Precede with the <code>m</code> prefix to show advanced
options.</p>
<p><code>#optionsfull</code> Show advanced game option settings. No
default key. Precede with the <code>m</code> prefix to execute the
simpler options command. (Mainly useful if you use
<code>BINDING=O:optionsfull</code> to switch ‘<code>O</code>’ from
simple options back to traditional advanced options.)</p>
<p><code>#overview</code> Display information you’ve discovered about
the dungeon. Any visited level with an annotation is included, and many
things (altars, thrones, fountains, and so on; extra stairs leading to
another dungeon branch) trigger an automatic annotation. If dungeon
overview is chosen during end-of-game disclosure, every visited level
will be included regardless of annotations. Precede #overview with the
<code>m</code> prefix to display the dungeon overview as a menu where
you can select any visited level to add or remove an annotation without
needing to return to that level. This will also force all visited levels
to be displayed rather than just the <code>interesting</code> subset.
Autocompletes. Default keys are <code>^O</code>, and
<code>M-O</code>.</p>
<p><code>#panic</code> Test the panic routine. Terminates the current
game. Autocompletes. Debug mode only. Asks for confirmation; default is
<code>n</code> (no); continue playing. To really panic, respond with
<code>y</code>. You can set the <code>paranoid_confirmation:quit</code>
option to require a response of <code>yes</code> instead.</p>
<p><code>#pay</code> Pay your shopping bill. Default key is
<code>p</code>.</p>
<p><code>#perminv</code> If persistent inventory display is supported
and enabled (with the <code>perm_invent</code> option), interact with it
instead of with the map. You’ll be prompted for menu scrolling
keystrokes such as ‘<code>&gt;</code>’ and ‘<code>&lt;</code>’. Press
<code>Return</code> or <code>Escape</code> to resume normal play.
Default key is <code>|</code>.</p>
<p><code>#pickup</code> Pick up things at the current location. Default
key is <code>,</code>. The <code>m</code> prefix forces use of a
menu.</p>
<p><code>#polyself</code> Polymorph self. Autocompletes. Debug mode
only.</p>
<p><code>#pray</code> Pray to the gods for help. Autocompletes. Default
key is <code>M-p</code>. Praying too soon after receiving prior help is
a bad idea. (Hint: entering the dungeon alive is treated as having
received help. You probably shouldn’t start off a new game by praying
right away.) Since using this command by accident can cause trouble,
there is an option to make you confirm your intent before praying. It is
enabled by default, and you can reset the
<code>paranoid_confirmation</code> option to disable it.</p>
<p><code>#prevmsg</code> Show previously displayed game messages.
Default key is <code>^P</code>.</p>
<p><code>#puton</code> Put on an accessory (ring, amulet, etc). Default
key is <code>P</code>.</p>
<p><code>#quaff</code> Quaff (drink) something. Default key is
<code>q</code>. The <code>m</code> prefix skips drinking from a fountain
or sink if there is one at your location.</p>
<p><code>#quit</code> Quit the program without saving your game.
Autocompletes. Since using this command by accident would throw away the
current game, you are asked to confirm your intent before quitting.
Default response is <code>n</code> (no); continue playing. To really
quit, respond with <code>y</code>. You can set the
<code>paranoid_confirmation:quit</code> option to require a response of
<code>yes</code> instead.</p>
<p><code>#quiver</code> Select ammunition for quiver. Default key is
<code>Q</code>.</p>
<p><code>#read</code> Read a scroll, a spellbook, or something else.
Default key is <code>r</code>.</p>
<p><code>#redraw</code> Redraw the screen. Default key is
<code>^R</code>, and also <code>^L</code> if <code>number_pad</code> is
on.</p>
<p><code>#remove</code> Remove an accessory (ring, amulet, etc). Default
key is <code>R</code>.</p>
<p><code>#repeat</code> Repeat the previous command. Default key is
<code>^A</code>.</p>
<p><code>#reqmenu</code> Prefix key to modify the behavior or request
menu from some commands. Prevents autopickup when used with movement
commands. Default key is <code>m</code>.</p>
<p><code>#retravel</code> Travel to a previously selected travel

<p><code>#ride</code> Ride (or stop riding) a saddled creature.
Autocompletes. Default key is <code>M-R</code>.</p>
<p><code>#rub</code> Rub a lamp or a stone. Autocompletes. Default key
is <code>M-r</code>.</p>
<p><code>#run</code> Prefix key to run towards a direction. Default key
is <code>G</code> when <code>number_pad</code> is off, <code>5</code>
when <code>number_pad</code> is set to 1 or 3, otherwise
<code>M-5</code> when it is set to 2 or 4.</p>
<p><code>#rush</code> Prefix key to rush towards a direction. Default is
<code>g</code> when <code>number_pad</code> is off, <code>M-5</code>
when <code>number_pad</code> is set to 1 or 3, otherwise <code>5</code>
when it is set to 2 or 4.</p>
<p><code>#save</code> Save the game and exit the program. Default key is
<code>S</code>.</p>
<p><code>#saveoptions</code> Save configuration options to the config
file. This will overwrite the file, removing all comments, so if you
have manually edited the config file, don’t use this.</p>
<p><code>#search</code> Search for traps and secret doors around you.
Default key is <code>s</code>.</p>
<p><code>#seeall</code> Show all equipment in use. Default key is
<code>*</code>. Will display in-use items in a menu even when there is
only one.</p>
<p><code>#seeamulet</code> Show the amulet currently worn. Default key
is <code>"</code>. Using the ‘<code>m</code>’ prefix will force the
display of a worn amulet in a menu rather than with just a message.</p>
<p><code>#seearmor</code> Show the armor currently worn. Default key is
<code>[</code>. Will display worn armor in a menu even when there is
only thing worn.</p>
<p><code>#seerings</code> Show the ring(s) currently worn. Default key
is <code>=</code>. Will display worn rings in a menu if there are two
(or there is just one and is a meat ring rather than a <code>real</code>
ring). Use the ‘<code>m</code>’ prefix to force a menu for one ring.</p>
<p><code>#seetools</code> Show the tools currently in use. Default key
is <code>(</code>. Will display the result in a message if there is one
tool in use (worn blindfold or towel or lenses, lit lamp(s) and/or
candle(s), leashes attached to pets). Will display a menu if there are
more than one or if the command is preceded by the ‘<code>m</code>’
prefix.</p>
<p><code>#seeweapon</code> Show the weapon currently wielded. Default
key is <code>)</code>. If dual-wielding, a separate message about the
secondary weapon will be given. Using the ‘<code>m</code>’ prefix will
force a menu and it will include primary weapon, alternate weapon even
when not dual-wielding, and also whatever is currently assigned to the
quiver slot.</p>
<p><code>#shell</code> Do a shell escape, switching from NetHack to a
subprocess. Can be disabled at the time the program is built. When
enabled, access for specific users can be controlled by the system
configuration file. Use the shell command ‘<code>exit</code>’ to return
to the game. Default key is <code>!</code>.</p>
<p><code>#showgold</code> Report the gold in your inventory, including
gold you know about in containers you’re carrying. If you are inside a
shop, report any credit or debt you have in that shop. Default key is
<code>$</code>.</p>
<p><code>#showspells</code> List and reorder known spells. Default key
is <code>+</code>.</p>
<p><code>#showtrap</code> Describe an adjacent trap, possibly covered by
objects or a monster. To be eligible, the trap must already be
discovered. (The <code>#terrain</code> command can display your map with
all objects and monsters temporarily removed, making it possible to see
all discovered traps.) Default key is <code>^</code>.</p>
<p><code>#sit</code> Sit down. Autocompletes. Default key is
<code>M-s</code>.</p>
<p><code>#stats</code> Show memory usage statistics. Autocompletes.
Debug mode only.</p>
<p><code>#suspend</code> Suspend the game, switching from NetHack to the
terminal it was started from without performing save-and-exit. Can be
disabled at the time the program is built. When enabled, mainly useful
for <em>tty</em> and <em>curses</em> interfaces on UNIX. Use the shell
command ‘<code>fg</code>’ to return to the game. Default key is
<code>^Z</code>.</p>
<p><code>#swap</code> Swap wielded and secondary weapons. Default key is
<code>x</code>.</p>
<p><code>#takeoff</code> Take off one piece of armor. Default key is
<code>T</code>.</p>
<p><code>#takeoffall</code> Remove all armor. Default key is
<code>A</code>.</p>
<p><code>#teleport</code> Teleport around the level. Default key is
<code>^T</code>.</p>
<p><code>#terrain</code> Show map without obstructions. In normal play
you can view the explored portion of the current level’s map without
monsters; without monsters and objects; or without monsters, objects,
and traps. If there are visible clouds of gas in view, they are treated
like traps when deciding whether to show them or the floor underneath
them. In explore mode, you can choose to view the full map rather than
just its explored portion. In debug mode there are additional choices.
Autocompletes. Default key is <code>&lt;del&gt;</code> or
<code>&lt;delete&gt;</code> (see <em>Del</em> above).</p>
<p><code>#therecmdmenu</code> Show a menu of possible actions directed
at a location next to you. The menu is limited to a subset of the
likeliest actions, not an exhaustive set of all possibilities.
Autocompletes.</p>
<p><code>#throw</code> Throw something. Default key is
<code>t</code>.</p>
<p><code>#timeout</code> Look at the timeout queue. Autocompletes. Debug
mode only.</p>
<p><code>#tip</code> Tip over a container (bag or box) to pour out its
contents. When there are containers on the floor, the game will prompt
to pick one of them or “tip something being carried”. If the latter is
chosen, there will be another prompt for which item from inventory to
tip. The ‘<code>m</code>’ prefix makes the command skip containers on
the floor and pick one from inventory, except for the special case of
<code>menustyle :traditional</code> with two or more containers present;
that situation will start with the floor container menu. Autocompletes.
Default key is <code>M-T</code>.</p>
<p><code>#travel</code> Travel to a specific location on the map.
Default key is <code>_</code>. Using the <code>request menu</code>
prefix shows a menu of interesting targets in sight without asking to
move the cursor. When picking a target with cursor and the
<code>autodescribe</code> option is on, the top line will show “(no
travel path)” if your character does not know of a path to that
location. See also #retravel.</p>
<p><code>#turn</code> Turn undead away. Autocompletes. Default key is
<code>M-t</code>.</p>
<p><code>#twoweapon</code> Toggle two-weapon combat on or off.
Autocompletes. Default key is <code>X</code>, and also <code>M-2</code>
if <code>number_pad</code> is off. Note that you must use suitable
weapons for this type of combat, or it will be automatically turned
off.</p>
<p><code>#untrap</code> Untrap something (trap, door, or chest). Default
key is <code>M-u</code>, and <code>u</code> if <code>number_pad</code>
is on. In some circumstances it can also be used to rescue trapped
monsters.</p>
<p><code>#up</code> Go up a staircase. Default key is
<code>&lt;</code>.</p>
<p><code>#vanquished</code> List vanquished monsters by type and count.
Note that the vanquished monsters list includes all monsters killed by
traps and each other as well as by you, and omits any which got removed
from the game without being killed (perhaps by genocide, or by a
mollified shopkeeper dismissing summoned Kops) or were already corpses
when placed on the map. Using the <code>request menu</code> prefix prior
to #vanquished brings up a menu of sorting orders available (provided
that the vanquished monsters list contains at least two types of
monsters). Whichever ordering is picked gets assigned to the
<code>sortvanquished</code> option so is remembered for subsequent
#vanquished requests. The <code>#genocided</code> command shares this
sorting order. During end-of-game disclosure, when asked whether to show
vanquished monsters answering ‘<code>a</code>’ will let you choose from
the sort menu. Autocompletes. Default key is <code>M-V</code>.</p>
<p><code>#version</code> Print compile time options for this version of
NetHack. The second paragraph lists the user interface(s) that are
included. If there are more than one, you can use the
<code>windowtype</code> option in your run-time configuration file to
select the one you want. Autocompletes. Default key is
<code>M-v</code>.</p>
<p><code>#versionshort</code> Show the program’s version number, plus
the date and time that the running copy was built from sources (not the
version’s release date). Default key is <code>v</code>.</p>
<p><code>#vision</code> Show vision array. Autocompletes. Debug mode
only.</p>
<p><code>#wait</code> Rest one move while doing nothing. Default key is
<code>.</code>, and also ‘ ’ if <code>rest_on_space</code> is on.</p>
<p><code>#wear</code> Wear a piece of armor. Default key is
<code>W</code>.</p>
<p><code>#whatdoes</code> Tell what a key does. Default key is
<code>&amp;</code>.</p>
<p><code>#whatis</code> Show what type of thing a symbol corresponds to.
Default key is <code>/</code>.</p>
<p><code>#wield</code> Wield a weapon. Default key is
<code>w</code>.</p>
<p><code>#wipe</code> Wipe off your face. Autocompletes. Default key is
<code>M-w</code>.</p>
<p><code>#wizborn</code> Show monster birth, death, genocide, and
extinct statistics. Debug mode only.</p>
<p><code>#wizbury</code> Bury objects under and around you.
Autocompletes. Debug mode only.</p>
<p><code>#wizcast</code> Cast any spell. Debug mode only.</p>
<p><code>#wizdetect</code> Reveal hidden things (secret doors or traps
or unseen monsters) within a modest radius. No time elapses.
Autocompletes. Debug mode only. Default key is <code>^E</code>.</p>
<p><code>#wizgenesis</code> Create a monster. May be prefixed by a count
to create more than one. Autocompletes. Debug mode only. Default key is

<p><code>#wizidentify</code> Identify all items in inventory.
Autocompletes. Debug mode only. Default key is <code>^I</code>.</p>
<p><code>#wizintrinsic</code> Set one or more intrinsic attributes.
Autocompletes. Debug mode only.</p>
<p><code>#wizkill</code> Remove monsters from play by just pointing at
them. By default the hero gets credit or blame for killing the targets.
Precede this command with the ‘<code>m</code>’ prefix to override that.
Autocompletes. Debug mode only.</p>
<p><code>#wizlevelport</code> Teleport to another level. Autocompletes.
Debug mode only. Default key is <code>^V</code>.</p>
<p><code>#wizmap</code> Map the level. Autocompletes. Debug mode only.
Default key is <code>^F</code>.</p>
<p><code>#wizrumorcheck</code> Verify rumor boundaries by displaying
first and last true rumors and first and last false rumors. Also
displays first, second, and last random engravings, epitaphs, and
hallucinatory monsters. Autocompletes. Debug mode only.</p>
<p><code>#wizseenv</code> Show map locations’ seen vectors.
Autocompletes. Debug mode only.</p>
<p><code>#wizsmell</code> Smell monster. Autocompletes. Debug mode
only.</p>
<p><code>#wizwhere</code> Show locations of special levels.
Autocompletes. Debug mode only.</p>
<p><code>#wizwish</code> Wish for something. Autocompletes. Debug mode
only. Default key is <code>^W</code>.</p>
<p><code>#wmode</code> Show wall modes. Autocompletes. Debug mode
only.</p>
<p><code>#zap</code> Zap a wand. Default key is <code>z</code>.</p>
<p><code>#?</code> Help menu: get the list of available extended
commands.</p>
<p>If your keyboard has a meta key (which, when pressed in combination
with another key, modifies it by setting the <code>meta</code> [8th, or
<code>high</code>] bit), you can invoke many extended commands by
meta-ing the first letter of the command.</p>
<p>On <em>Windows</em> and <em>MS-DOS</em>, the <code>Alt</code> key can
be used in this fashion. On other systems, if typing <code>Alt</code>
plus another key transmits a two character sequence consisting of an
<strong>Escape</strong> followed by the other key, you may set the
<code>altmeta</code> option to have NetHack combine them into
meta+<code>&lt;key&gt;</code>. (This combining action only takes place
when NetHack is expecting a command to execute, not when accepting input
to name something or to make a wish.)</p>
<p>Unlike control characters, where ^x and ^X denote the same thing,
meta characters are case-sensitive: M-x and M-X represent different
things. Some commands which can be run via a meta character require that
the letter be capitalized because the lower-case equivalent is used for
another command, so the three key combination
meta+Shift+<code>&lt;letter&gt;</code> is needed.</p>
<p><code>M-?</code> #? (not supported by all platforms)</p>
<p><code>M-2</code> #twoweapon (unless the <code>number_pad</code>
option is enabled)</p>
<p><code>M-a</code> #adjust</p>
<p><code>M-A</code> #annotate</p>
<p><code>M-c</code> #chat</p>
<p><code>M-C</code> #conduct</p>
<p><code>M-d</code> #dip</p>

<section id="rooms-and-corridors" class="level2">
<h2>5. Rooms and corridors</h2>
<p>Rooms and corridors in the dungeon are either lit or dark. Any lit
areas within your line of sight will be displayed; dark areas are only
displayed if they are within one space of you. Walls and corridors
remain on the map as you explore them.</p>
<p>Secret corridors are hidden and appear to be solid rock. You can find
them with the <code>s</code> (search) command when adjacent to them.
Multiple search attempts may be needed. When searching is successful,
secret corridors become ordinary open corridor locations. Mapping magic
reveals secret corridors, so converts them into ordinary corridors and
shows them as such.</p>
<section id="doorways" class="level3">
<h3>5.1. Doorways</h3>
<p>Doorways connect rooms and corridors. Some doorways have no doors;
you can walk right through. Others have doors in them, which may be
open, closed, or locked. To open a closed door, use the <code>o</code>
(open) command; to close it again, use the <code>c</code> (close)
command. By default the <code>autoopen</code> option is enabled, so
simply attempting to walk onto a closed door’s location will attempt to
open it without needing <code>o</code>. Opening via
<code>autoopen</code> will not work if you are <em>confused</em> or
<em>stunned</em> or suffer from the <em>fumbling</em> attribute.</p>
<p>Open doors cannot be entered diagonally; you must approach them
straight on, horizontally or vertically. Doorways without doors are not
restricted in this fashion except on one particular level (described by
<code>#overview</code> as “a primitive area”).</p>
<p>Unlocking magic exists but usually won’t be available early on. You
can get through a locked door without magic by first using an unlocking
tool with the <code>a</code> (apply) command, and then opening it. By
default the <code>autounlock</code> option is also enabled, so if you
attempt to open (via <code>o</code> or <code>autoopen)</code> a locked
door while carrying an unlocking tool, you’ll be asked whether to use it
on the door’s lock. Alternatively, you can break a closed door (whether
locked or not) down by kicking it via the <code>^D</code> (kick)
command. Kicking down a door destroys it and makes a lot of noise which
might wake sleeping monsters.</p>
<p>Some closed doors are booby-trapped and will explode if an attempt is
made to open (when unlocked) or unlock (when locked) or kick down. Like
kicking, an explosion destroys the door and makes a lot of noise. The
<code>#untrap</code> command can be used to search a door for traps but
might take multiple attempts to find one. When one is found, you’ll be
asked whether to try to disarm it. If you accede, success will eliminate
the trap but failure will set off the trap’s explosion. (If you decline,
you effectively forget that a trap was found there.)</p>
<p>Closed doors can be useful for shutting out monsters. Most monsters
cannot open closed doors, although a few don’t need to (for example,
ghosts can walk through doors and fog clouds can flow under them). Some
monsters who can open doors can also use unlocking tools. And some
(giants) can smash doors.</p>
<p>Secret doors are hidden and appear to be ordinary wall (from inside a
room) or solid rock (from outside). You can find them with the
<code>s</code> (search) command but it might take multiple tries
(possibly many tries if your luck is poor). Once found they are in all
ways equivalent to normal doors. Mapping magic does not reveal secret
doors.</p>
</section>
<section id="traps" class="level3">
<h3>5.2. Traps (<code>^</code>)</h3>
<p>There are traps throughout the dungeon to snare the unwary intruder.
For example, you may suddenly fall into a pit and be stuck for a few
turns trying to climb out (see below). A trap usually won’t appear on
your map until you trigger it by moving onto it, you see someone else
trigger it, or you discover it with the <code>s</code> (search) command
(multiple attempts are often needed; if your luck is poor, many attempts
might be needed). <em>Wands of secret door detection</em> and <em>spell
of detect unseen</em> also reveal traps within a modest radius but only
if the trap is also within line-of-sight (whether you can see at the
time or not). There is also other magic which can reveal traps.</p>
<p>Monsters can fall prey to traps, too, which can potentially be used
as a defensive strategy. Unfortunately traps can be harmful to your
pet(s) as well. Monsters, including pets, usually will avoid moving onto
a trap which is shown on your map if they have encountered that type of
trap before.</p>
<p>Some traps such as pits, bear traps, and webs hold you in one place.
You can escape by simply trying to move to an adjacent spot and repeat
as needed; eventually you will get free.</p>
<p>Other traps can send you to different locations. Teleporters send you
elsewhere on the same dungeon level. Level teleporters send you to a
random dungeon level, the destination chosen from a few levels lower all
the way to the top. These traps choose a new destination each time
they’re activated. Trap doors and holes also send you to another level,
but one which is always below the current level. Usually that will be
the next level down but it can be farther. Unlike (level) teleporters,
the destination level of a particular trap door or hole is persistent,
so falling into one will bring you to the same level each time—though
not necessarily the same spot on the level. Magic portals behave
similarly, but with some additional variation. Some portals are two-way
and their remote destination is always the same: another portal which
can take you back. Others are one-way and send you to a specific
destination level but not necessarily to a specific location there.</p>
<p>There is a special multi-level branch of the dungeon with pre-mapped
levels based on the classic computer game “<em>Sokoban</em>.” In that
game, you operate as a warehouse worker who pushes crates around
obstacles to position them at designated locations. In NetHack, the goal
is to push boulders into pits or holes until those traps have all been
nullified, giving access to whatever is beyond them. In the Sokoban
game, you can only move in the four cardinal compass directions, and a
crate in its final destination blocks further access to that spot. In
the Sokoban levels of NetHack, you can move diagonally (unless that
would let you pass between two neighboring boulders) but you can only
push boulders in the four cardinal directions, and a boulder which fills
a pit or hole removes both the boulder and the trap so opens up normal
access to that spot. With careful foresight, it is possible to complete
all of the levels according to the traditional rules of Sokoban. (Hint:
to solve Sokoban puzzles, you often need to move things away from their
eventual destinations in order to open up more room to maneuver.) Since
NetHack does not support an <em>undo</em> capability, some allowances
are permitted in case you get stuck. For example, each level has at
least one extra boulder. Also, it is possible to drop everything in
order to be able to squeeze into the same location as a boulder (and
then presumably move past it), or to destroy a boulder with magic or
tools, or to create new boulders with a <em>scroll of earth</em>.
However, doing such things will lower your luck without any specific
message given about that. See the <em>Conduct</em> section for
information about getting feedback for your actions in Sokoban.</p>
</section>
<section id="stairs-and-ladders" class="level3">
<h3>5.3. Stairs and ladders (<code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>)</h3>
<p>In general, each level in the dungeon will have a staircase going up
(<code>&lt;</code>) to the previous level and another going down
(<code>&gt;</code>) to the next level. There are some exceptions though.
For instance, fairly early in the dungeon you will find a level with two
down staircases, one continuing into the dungeon and the other branching
into an area known as the Gnomish Mines. Those mines eventually hit a
dead end, so after exploring them (if you choose to do so), you’ll need
to climb back up to the main dungeon.</p>
<p>When you traverse a set of stairs, or trigger a trap which sends you
to another level, the level you’re leaving will be deactivated and
stored in a file on disk. If you’re moving to a previously visited
level, it will be loaded from its file on disk and reactivated. If
you’re moving to a level which has not yet been visited, it will be
created (from scratch for most random levels, from a template for some
<code>special</code> levels, or loaded from the remains of an earlier
game for a <code>bones</code> level as briefly described below).
Monsters are only active on the current level; those on other levels are
essentially placed into stasis.</p>
<p>Ordinarily when you climb a set of stairs, you will arrive on the
corresponding staircase at your destination. However, pets (see below)
and some other monsters will follow along if they’re close enough when
you travel up or down stairs, and occasionally one of these creatures
will displace you during the climb. When that occurs, the pet or other
monster will arrive on the staircase and you will end up nearby.</p>
<p>Ladders serve the same purpose as staircases, and the two types of
inter-level connections are nearly indistinguishable during game
play.</p>
</section>
<section id="shops-and-shopping" class="level3">
<h3>5.4. Shops and shopping</h3>
<p>Occasionally you will run across a room with a shopkeeper near the
door and many items lying on the floor. You can buy items by picking
them up and then using the <code>p</code> command. You can inquire about
the price of an item prior to picking it up by using the
<code>#chat</code> command while standing on it. Using an item prior to
paying for it will incur a charge, and the shopkeeper won’t allow you to
leave the shop until you have paid any debt you owe.</p>
<p>You can sell items to a shopkeeper by dropping them to the floor
while inside a shop. You will either be offered an amount of gold and
asked whether you’re willing to sell, or you’ll be told that the
shopkeeper isn’t interested (generally, your item needs to be compatible
with the type of merchandise carried by the shop).</p>
<p>If you drop something in a shop by accident, the shopkeeper will
usually claim ownership without offering any compensation. You’ll have
to buy it back if you want to reclaim it.</p>
<p>Shopkeepers sometime run out of money. When that happens, you’ll be
offered credit instead of gold when you try to sell something. Credit
can be used to pay for purchases, but it is only good in the shop where
it was obtained; other shopkeepers won’t honor it. (If you happen to
find a <code>credit card</code> in the dungeon, don’t bother trying to
use it in shops; shopkeepers will not accept it.)</p>
<p>The <code>$</code> command, which reports the amount of gold you are
carrying, will also show current shop debt or credit, if any. The
<code>Iu</code> command lists unpaid items (those which still belong to
the shop) if you are carrying any. The <code>Ix</code> command shows an
inventory-like display of any unpaid items which have been used up,
along with other shop fees, if any.</p>
<section id="shop-idiosyncrasies" class="level4">
<h4>5.4.1. Shop idiosyncrasies</h4>
<p>Several aspects of shop behavior might be unexpected. - The price of
a given item can vary due to a variety of factors. - A shopkeeper treats
the spot immediately inside the door as if it were outside the shop. -
While the shopkeeper watches you like a hawk, he or she will generally
ignore any other customers. - If a shop is “closed for inventory,” it
will not open of its own accord. - Shops do not get restocked with new
items, regardless of inventory depletion.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="movement-feedback" class="level3">
<h3>5.5. Movement feedback</h3>
<p>Moving around the map usually provides no feedback—other than drawing
the hero at the new location—unless you step on an object or pile of
objects, or on a trap, or attempt to move onto a spot where a monster is
located. There are several options which can be used to augment the
normal feedback.</p>
<p>The <code>pile_limit</code> option controls how many objects can be
in a pile—sharing the same map location—for the game to state “there are
objects here” instead of listing them. The default is <code>5</code>.
Setting it to <code>1</code> would always give that message instead of
listing any objects. Setting it to <code>0</code> is a special case
which will always list all objects no matter how big a pile is. Note
that the number refers to the count of separate stacks of objects
present rather than the sum of the quantities of those stacks (so
<code>7 arrows</code> or <code>25 gold pieces</code> will each count as
1 rather than as 7 and 25, respectively, and total to 2 when both are at
the same location).</p>
<p>The <code>nopickup</code> command prefix (default ‘<code>m</code>’)
can be used before a movement direction to step on objects without
attempting auto-pickup and without giving feedback about them.</p>
<p>The <code>mention_walls</code> option controls whether you get
feedback if you try to walk into a wall or solid stone or off the edge
of the map. Normally nothing happens (unless the hero is blind and no
wall is shown, then the wall that is being bumped into will be drawn on
the map). This option also gives feedback when rushing or running stops
for some non-obvious reason.</p>
<p>The <code>mention_decor</code> option controls whether you get
feedback when walking on <code>furniture.</code> Normally stepping onto
stairs or a fountain or an altar or various other things doesn’t elicit
anything unless it is covered by one or more objects so is obscured on
the map. Setting this option to true will describe such things even when
they aren’t obscured. Doorless doorways and open doors aren’t considered
worthy of mention; closed doors (if you can move onto their spots) and
broken doors are. Assuming that you’re able to do so, moving onto water
or lava or ice will give feedback if not yet on that type of terrain but
not repeat it (unless there has been some intervening message) when
moving from water to another water spot, or lava to lava, or ice to ice.
Moving off of any of those back onto <code>normal</code> terrain will
give one message too, unless there is feedback about one or more
objects, in which case the back on land circumstance is implied.</p>
<p>The <code>confirm</code> and <code>safe_pet</code> options control
what happens when you try to move onto a peaceful monster’s spot or a
tame one’s spot.</p>
<p>The <code>nopickup</code> command prefix (default ‘<code>m</code>’)
is also the move-without-attacking prefix and can be used to try to step
onto a visible monster’s spot without the move being considered an
attack (see the <em>Fighting</em> subsection of <em>Monsters</em>
below). The <code>fight</code> command prefix (default ‘<code>F</code>’;
also ‘<code>-</code>’ if <code>number_pad</code> is on) can be used to
force an attack, when guessing where an unseen monster is or when
deliberately attacking a peaceful or tame creature.</p>
<p>The <code>run_mode</code> option controls how frequently the map gets
redrawn when moving more than one step in a single command (so when
rushing, running, or traveling).</p>

<section id="rogue-level" class="level3">
<h3>5.6. Rogue level</h3>
<p>One dungeon level (occurring in mid to late teens of the main
dungeon) is a tribute to the ancestor game <em>hack</em>’s inspiration
<em>rogue</em>.</p>
<p>It is usually displayed differently from other levels: possibly in
characters instead of tiles, or without line-drawing symbols if already
in characters; also, gold is shown as <code>*</code> rather than
<code>$</code> and stairs are shown as <code>%</code> rather than
<code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code>. There are some minor
differences in actual game play: doorways lack doors; a scroll, wand, or
spell of light used in a room lights up the whole room rather than
within a radius around your character. And monsters represented by
lower-case letters aren’t randomly generated on the rogue level.</p>
<p>The slight strangeness of this level is a feature, not a bug….</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="monsters" class="level2">
<h2>6. Monsters</h2>
<p>Monsters you cannot see are not displayed on the screen. Beware! You
may suddenly come upon one in a dark place. Some magic items can help
you locate them before they locate you (which some monsters can do very
well).</p>
<p>The commands <code>/</code> and <code>;</code> may be used to obtain
information about those monsters who are displayed on the screen. The
command <code>#name</code> (by default bound to <code>C</code>), allows
you to assign a name to a monster, which may be useful to help
distinguish one from another when multiple monsters are present.
Assigning a name which is just a space will remove any prior name.</p>
<p>The extended command <code>#chat</code> can be used to interact with
an adjacent monster. There is no actual dialog (in other words, you
don’t get to choose what you’ll say), but chatting with some monsters
such as a shopkeeper or the Oracle of Delphi can produce useful
results.</p>
<section id="fighting" class="level3">
<h3>6.1. Fighting</h3>
<p>If you see a monster and you wish to fight it, just attempt to walk
into it. Many monsters you find will mind their own business unless you
attack them. Some of them are very dangerous when angered. Remember:
discretion is the better part of valor.</p>
<p>In most circumstances, if you attempt to attack a peaceful monster by
moving into its location, you’ll be asked to confirm your intent. By
default an answer of <code>y</code> acknowledges that intent, which can
be error prone if you’re using <code>y</code> to move. You can set the
<code>paranoid_confirmation:attack</code> option to require a response
of <code>yes</code> instead.</p>
<p>If you can’t see a monster (if it is invisible, or if you are
blinded), the symbol <code>I</code> will be shown when you learn of its
presence. If you attempt to walk into it, you will try to fight it just
like a monster that you can see; of course, if the monster has moved,
you will attack empty air. If you guess that the monster has moved and
you don’t wish to fight, you can use the <code>m</code> command to move
without fighting; likewise, if you don’t remember a monster but want to
try fighting anyway, you can use the <code>F</code> command.</p>
</section>
<section id="your-pet" class="level3">
<h3>6.2. Your pet</h3>
<p>You start the game with a little dog
(<strong><code>d</code></strong>), kitten
(<strong><code>f</code></strong>), or pony
(<strong><code>u</code></strong>), which follows you about the dungeon
and fights monsters with you. Like you, your pet needs food to survive.
Dogs and cats usually feed themselves on fresh carrion and other meats;
horses need vegetarian food which is harder to come by. If you’re
worried about your pet or want to train it, you can feed it, too, by
throwing it food. A properly trained pet can be very useful under
certain circumstances.</p>
<p>Your pet also gains experience from killing monsters, and can grow
over time, gaining hit points and doing more damage. Initially, your pet
may even be better at killing things than you, which makes pets useful
for low-level characters.</p>
<p>Your pet will follow you up and down staircases if it is next to you
when you move. Otherwise your pet will be stranded and may become wild.
Similarly, when you trigger certain types of traps which alter your
location (for instance, a trap door which drops you to a lower dungeon
level), any adjacent pet will accompany you and any non-adjacent pet
will be left behind. Your pet may trigger such traps itself; you will
not be carried along with it even if adjacent at the time.</p>
</section>
<section id="steeds" class="level3">
<h3>6.3. Steeds</h3>
<p>Some types of creatures in the dungeon can actually be ridden if you
have the right equipment and skill. Convincing a wild beast to let you
saddle it up is difficult to say the least. Many a dungeoneer has had to
resort to magic and wizardry in order to forge the alliance. Once you do
have the beast under your control however, you can easily climb in and
out of the saddle with the <code>#ride</code> command. Lead the beast
around the dungeon when riding, in the same manner as you would move
yourself. It is the beast that you will see displayed on the map.</p>
<p>Riding skill is managed by the <code>#enhance</code> command. See the
section on Weapon proficiency for more information about that.</p>
<p>Use the <code>a</code> (apply) command and pick a saddle in your
inventory to attempt to put that saddle on an adjacent creature. If
successful, it will be transferred to that creature’s inventory.</p>
<p>Use the <code>#loot</code> command while adjacent to a saddled
creature to try to remove the saddle from that creature. If successful,
it will be transferred to your inventory.</p>
</section>
<section id="bones-levels" class="level3">
<h3>6.4. Bones levels</h3>
<p>You may encounter the shades and corpses of other adventurers (or
even former incarnations of yourself!) and their personal effects.
Ghosts are hard to kill, but easy to avoid, since they’re slow and do
little damage. You can plunder the deceased adventurer’s possessions;
however, they are likely to be cursed. Beware of whatever killed the
former player; it is probably still lurking around, gloating over its
last victory.</p>
</section>
<section id="persistence-of-monsters" class="level3">
<h3>6.5. Persistence of Monsters</h3>
<p>Monsters (a generic reference which also includes humans and pets)
are only shown while they can be seen or otherwise sensed. Moving to a
location where you can’t see or sense a monster any more will result in
it disappearing from your map, similarly if it is the one who moved
rather than you.</p>
<p>However, if you encounter a monster which you can’t see or
sense—perhaps it is invisible and has just tapped you on the noggin—a
special “remembered, unseen monster” marker will be displayed at the
location where you think it is. That will persist until you have proven
that there is no monster there, even if the unseen monster moves to
another location or you move to a spot where the marker’s location
ordinarily wouldn’t be seen any more.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="objects" class="level2">
<h2>7. Objects</h2>
<p>When you find something in the dungeon, it is common to want to pick
it up. In NetHack, this is accomplished by using the <code>,</code>
command. If <code>autopickup</code> option is on, you will automatically
pick up the object by walking over, unless you move with the
<code>m</code> prefix.</p>
<p>If you’re carrying too many items, NetHack will tell you so and you
won’t be able to pick up anything more. Otherwise, it will add the
object(s) to your pack and tell you what you just picked up.</p>
<p>As you add items to your inventory, you also add the weight of that
object to your load. The amount that you can carry depends on your
strength and your constitution. The stronger and sturdier you are, the
less the additional load will affect you. There comes a point, though,
when the weight of all of that stuff you are carrying around with you
through the dungeon will encumber you. Your reactions will get slower
and you’ll burn calories faster, requiring food more frequently to cope
with it. Eventually, you’ll be so overloaded that you’ll either have to
discard some of what you’re carrying or collapse under its weight.</p>
<p>NetHack will tell you how badly you have loaded yourself. If you are
encumbered, one of the conditions <code>Burdened</code>,
<code>Stressed</code>, <code>Strained</code>, <code>Overtaxed</code>, or
<code>Overloaded</code> will be shown on the bottom line status
display.</p>
<p>When you pick up an object, it is assigned an inventory letter. Many
commands that operate on objects must ask you to find out which object
you want to use. When NetHack asks you to choose a particular object you
are carrying, you are usually presented with a list of inventory letters
to choose from (see Commands, above).</p>
<p>Some objects, such as weapons, are easily differentiated. Others,
like scrolls and potions, are given descriptions which vary according to
type. During a game, any two objects with the same description are the
same type. However, the descriptions will vary from game to game.</p>
<p>When you use one of these objects, if its effect is obvious, NetHack
will remember what it is for you. If its effect isn’t extremely obvious,
you will be asked what you want to call this type of object so you will
recognize it later. You can also use the <code>#name</code> command, for
the same purpose at any time, to name all objects of a particular type
or just an individual object. When you use <code>#name</code> on an
object which has already been named, specifying a space as the value
will remove the prior name instead of assigning a new one.</p>
<section id="curses-and-blessings" class="level3">
<h3>7.1. Curses and Blessings</h3>
<p>Any object that you find may be cursed, even if the object is
otherwise helpful. The most common effect of a curse is being stuck with
(and to) the item. Cursed weapons weld themselves to your hand when
wielded, so you cannot unwield them. Any cursed item you wear is not
removable by ordinary means. In addition, cursed arms and armor usually,
but not always, bear negative enchantments that make them less effective
in combat. Other cursed objects may act poorly or detrimentally in other
ways.</p>
<p>Objects can also be blessed instead. Blessed items usually work
better or more beneficially than normal uncursed items. For example, a
blessed weapon will do slightly more damage against demons.</p>
<p>Objects which are neither cursed nor blessed are referred to as
uncursed. They could just as easily have been described as unblessed,
but the uncursed designation is what you will see within the game. A
“glass half full versus glass half empty” situation; make of that what
you will.</p>
<p>There are magical means of bestowing or removing curses upon objects,
so even if you are stuck with one, you can still have the curse lifted
and the item removed. Priests and Priestesses have an innate sensitivity
to this property in any object, so they can more easily avoid cursed
objects than other character roles. Dropping objects onto an altar will
reveal their bless or curse state provided that you can see them
land.</p>
<p>An item with unknown status will be reported in your inventory with
no prefix. An item which you know the state of will be distinguished in
your inventory by the presence of the word <code>cursed</code>,
<code>uncursed</code>, or <code>blessed</code> in the description of the
item. In some cases <code>uncursed</code> will be omitted as being
redundant when enough other information is displayed. The
<code>implicit_uncursed</code> option can be used to control this;
toggle it off to have <code>uncursed</code> be displayed even when that
can be deduced from other attributes.</p>
<p>Sometimes the bless or curse state of objects is referred to as their
“<code>BUC</code>” attribute, for Blessed, Uncursed, or Cursed state, or
“<code>BUCX</code>” for Blessed, Uncursed, Cursed, or unknown. (The term
<em>beatitude</em> is occasionally used as well.)</p>
</section>
<section id="artifacts" class="level3">
<h3>7.2. Artifacts</h3>
<p>Some objects have been imbued with special powers and are known as
<strong>Artifacts</strong>. They have specific types (such as long sword
or orcish dagger) and distinct names such as <em>Giantslayer</em> or
<em>Grimtooth</em>. Artifact weapons typically do more damage than their
ordinary counterparts. Some do extra damage against all monsters, others
only against specific types of monsters so aren’t better than regular
weapons against other types. Some confer defensive capabilities when
wielded or have other powers that aren’t listed here.</p>
<p>You might find them simply lying on the floor, including but not
limited to inside shops, or be granted as a reward for
<code>#offer</code> on an altar to your patron deity. A few might be
dropped by monsters, or might be converted from an ordinary object of
the same type via assigning the right name. Or you might wish for them,
if you happen to be granted a wish, but such wishes can fail.</p>
<p>Some artifacts have a specific alignment, others don’t. You won’t
obtain aligned ones that have a different alignment from yours via
offering and might get a shock if you attempt to wish for any of those
or find one and attempt to use it.</p>
<p>Each role has a distinct artifact that is contained in the
<em>Quest</em> dungeon branch. These are commonly known as quest
artifacts. All are aligned and most are non-weapons. They won’t be found
randomly.</p>
<p>The ‘<code>\</code>’ and ‘<code>`a</code>’ commands will list
artifacts that you have fully identified (knowing the name and item type
isn’t sufficient).</p>
</section>
<section id="relics" class="level3">
<h3>7.3. Relics</h3>
<p>There are three unique items that are named and have limited special
powers but aren’t classified as artifacts. Each is guarded by a
particular monster and you’ll need to collect all three for use late in
the game. They are <em>the Bell of Opening</em>, <em>the Candelabrum of
Invocation</em>, and <em>the Book of the Dead</em>. Their corresponding
descriptions when not yet identified are silver bell, candelabrum, and
papyrus spellbook.</p>
</section>
<section id="weapons" class="level3">
<h3>7.4. Weapons (<code>)</code>)</h3>
<p>Given a chance, most monsters in the Mazes of Menace will
gratuitously try to kill you. You need weapons for self-defense (killing
them first). Without a weapon, you do only 1-2 hit points of damage
(plus bonuses, if any). Monk characters are an exception; they normally
do more damage with bare (or gloved) hands than they do with
weapons.</p>
<p>There are wielded weapons, like maces and swords, and thrown weapons,
like arrows and spears. To hit monsters with a weapon, you must wield it
and attack them, or throw it at them. You can simply elect to throw a
spear. To shoot an arrow, you should first wield a bow, then throw the
arrow. Crossbows shoot crossbow bolts. Slings hurl rocks and (other)
stones (like gems).</p>
<p>Enchanted weapons have a <code>plus</code> (or “to hit enhancement”
which can be either positive or negative) that adds to your chance to
hit and the damage you do to a monster. The only way to determine a
weapon’s enchantment is to have it magically identified somehow. Most
weapons are subject to some type of damage like rust. Such
<code>erosion</code> damage can be repaired.</p>
<p>The chance that an attack will successfully hit a monster, and the
amount of damage such a hit will do, depends upon many factors. Among
them are: type of weapon, quality of weapon (enchantment and/or
erosion), experience level, strength, dexterity, encumbrance, and
proficiency (see below). The monster’s armor class—a general defense
rating, not necessarily due to wearing of armor—is a factor too; also,
some monsters are particularly vulnerable to certain types of
weapons.</p>
<p>Many weapons can be wielded in one hand; some require both hands.
When wielding a two-handed weapon, you can not wear a shield, and vice
versa. When wielding a one-handed weapon, you can have another weapon
ready to use by setting things up with the <code>x</code> command, which
exchanges your primary (the one being wielded) and alternate weapons.
And if you have proficiency in the “two weapon combat” skill, you may
wield both weapons simultaneously as primary and secondary; use the
<code>X</code> command to engage or disengage that. Only some types of
characters (barbarians, for instance) have the necessary skill
available. Even with that skill, using two weapons at once incurs a
penalty in the chance to hit your target compared to using just one
weapon at a time.</p>
<p>There might be times when you’d rather not wield any weapon at all.
To accomplish that, wield <code>-</code>, or else use the <code>A</code>
command which allows you to unwield the current weapon in addition to
taking off other worn items.</p>
<p>Those of you in the audience who are AD&amp;D players, be aware that
each weapon which existed in AD&amp;D does roughly the same damage to
monsters in NetHack. Some of the more obscure weapons (such as the
<em>aklys</em>, <em>lucern hammer</em>, and <em>bec-de-corbin</em>) are
defined in an appendix to <em>Unearthed Arcana</em>, an AD&amp;D
supplement.</p>
<p>The commands to use weapons are <code>w</code> (wield),
<code>t</code> (throw), <code>f</code> (fire), <code>Q</code> (quiver),
<code>x</code> (exchange), <code>X</code> (twoweapon), and
<code>#enhance</code> (see below).</p>
<section id="throwing-and-shooting" class="level4">
<h4>7.4.1. Throwing and shooting</h4>
<p>You can throw just about anything via the <code>t</code> command. It
will prompt for the item to throw; picking <code>?</code> will list
things in your inventory which are considered likely to be thrown, or
picking <code>*</code> will list your entire inventory. After you’ve
chosen what to throw, you will be prompted for a direction rather than
for a specific target. The distance something can be thrown depends
mainly on the type of object and your strength. Arrows can be thrown by
hand, but can be thrown much farther and will be more likely to hit when
thrown while you are wielding a bow.</p>
<p>Some weapons will return when thrown. A boomerang—provided it fails
to hit anything—is an obvious example. If an aklys (thonged club) is
thrown while it is wielded, it will return even when it hits something.
A sufficiently strong hero can throw the warhammer <em>Mjollnir</em>;
when thrown by a <em>Valkyrie</em> it will return too. However, aklyses
and <em>Mjollnir</em> occasionally fail to return. Returning thrown
objects occasionally fail to be caught, sometimes even hitting the
thrower, but when caught they become re-wielded.</p>
<p>You can simplify the throwing operation by using the <code>Q</code>
command to select your preferred <code>missile</code>, then using the
<code>f</code> command to throw it. You’ll be prompted for a direction
as above, but you don’t have to specify which item to throw each time
you use <code>f</code>. There is also an option,
<code>autoquiver,</code> which has NetHack choose another item to
automatically fill your quiver (or quiver sack, or have at the ready)
when the inventory slot used for <code>Q</code> runs out. If your quiver
is empty, <code>autoquiver</code> is false, and you are wielding a
weapon which returns when thrown, you will throw that weapon instead of
filling the quiver. The fire command also has extra assistance, if
<code>fireassist</code> is on it will try to wield a launcher matching
the ammo in the quiver.</p>
<p>Some characters have the ability to throw or shoot a volley of
multiple items (from the same stack) in a single action. Knowing how to
load several rounds of ammunition at once—or hold several missiles in
your hand—and still hit a target is not an easy task. Rangers are among
those who are adept at this task, as are those with a high level of
proficiency in the relevant weapon skill (in bow skill if you’re
wielding one to shoot arrows, in crossbow skill if you’re wielding one
to shoot bolts, or in sling skill if you’re wielding one to shoot
stones). The number of items that the character has a chance to fire
varies from turn to turn. You can explicitly limit the number of shots
by using a numeric prefix before the <code>t</code> or <code>f</code>
command. For example, <code>2f</code> (or <code>n2f</code> if using
<code>number_pad</code> mode) would ensure that at most 2 arrows are
shot even if you could have fired 3. If you specify a larger number than
would have been shot (<code>4f</code> in this example), you’ll just end
up shooting the same number (3, here) as if no limit had been specified.
Once the volley is in motion, all of the items will travel in the same
direction; if the first ones kill a monster, the others can still
continue beyond that spot.</p>
</section>
<section id="weapon-proficiency" class="level4">
<h4>7.4.2. Weapon proficiency</h4>
<p>You will have varying degrees of skill in the weapons available.
Weapon proficiency, or weapon skills, affect how well you can use
particular types of weapons, and you’ll be able to improve your skills
as you progress through a game, depending on your role, your experience
level, and use of the weapons.</p>
<p>For the purposes of proficiency, weapons have been divided up into
various groups such as daggers, broadswords, and polearms. Each role has
a limit on what level of proficiency a character can achieve for each
group. For instance, wizards can become highly skilled in daggers or
staves but not in swords or bows.</p>
<p>The <code>#enhance</code> extended command is used to review current
weapons proficiency (also spell proficiency) and to choose which
skill(s) to improve when you’ve used one or more skills enough to become
eligible to do so. The skill rankings are <code>none</code> (sometimes
also referred to as <code>restricted</code>, because you won’t be able
to advance), <code>unskilled</code>, <code>basic</code>,
<code>skilled</code>, and <code>expert</code>. Restricted skills simply
will not appear in the list shown by <code>#enhance</code>. (Divine
intervention might unrestrict a particular skill, in which case it will
start at unskilled and be limited to basic.) Some characters can enhance
their barehanded combat or martial arts skill beyond expert to
<code>master</code> or <code>grand master</code>.</p>
<p>Use of a weapon in which you’re restricted or unskilled will incur a
modest penalty in the chance to hit a monster and also in the amount of
damage done when you do hit; at basic level, there is no penalty or
bonus; at skilled level, you receive a modest bonus in the chance to hit
and amount of damage done; at expert level, the bonus is higher. A
successful hit has a chance to boost your training towards the next
skill level (unless you’ve already reached the limit for this skill).
Once such training reaches the threshold for that next level, you’ll be
told that you feel more confident in your skills. At that point you can
use <code>#enhance</code> to increase one or more skills. Such skills
are not increased automatically because there is a limit to your total
overall skills, so you need to actively choose which skills to enhance
and which to ignore.</p>
</section>
<section id="two-weapon-combat" class="level4">
<h4>7.4.3. Two-Weapon combat</h4>
<p>Some characters can use two weapons at once. Setting things up to do
so can seem cumbersome but becomes second nature with use. To wield two
weapons, you need to use the <code>#twoweapon</code> command. But first
you need to have a weapon in each hand. (Note that your two weapons are
not fully equal; the one in the hand you normally wield with is
considered primary and the other one is considered secondary. The most
noticeable difference is after you stop—or before you begin, for that
matter—wielding two weapons at once. The primary is your wielded weapon
and the secondary is just an item in your inventory that’s been
designated as alternate weapon.)</p>
<p>If your primary weapon is wielded but your off hand is empty or has
the wrong weapon, use the sequence <strong><code>x</code></strong>,
<strong><code>w</code></strong>, <strong><code>x</code></strong> to
first swap your primary into your off hand, wield whatever you want as
secondary weapon, then swap them both back into the intended hands. If
your secondary or alternate weapon is correct but your primary one is
not, simply use <strong><code>w</code></strong> to wield the primary.
Lastly, if neither hand holds the correct weapon, use
<strong><code>w</code></strong>, <strong><code>x</code></strong>,
<strong><code>w</code></strong> to first wield the intended secondary,
swap it to off hand, and then wield the primary.</p>
<p>The whole process can be simplified via use of the
<code>pushweapon</code> option. When it is enabled, then using
<code>w</code> to wield something causes the currently wielded weapon to
become your alternate weapon. So the sequence
<strong><code>w</code></strong>, <strong><code>w</code></strong> can be
used to first wield the weapon you intend to be secondary, and then
wield the one you want as primary which will push the first into
secondary position.</p>
<p>When in two-weapon combat mode, using the <code>X</code> command
toggles back to single-weapon mode. Throwing or dropping either of the
weapons or having one of them be stolen or destroyed will also make you
revert to single-weapon combat.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="armor" class="level3">
<h3>7.5. Armor (<code>[</code>)</h3>
<p>Lots of unfriendly things lurk about; you need armor to protect
yourself from their blows. Some types of armor offer better protection
than others. Your armor class is a measure of this protection. Armor
class (AC) is measured as in AD&amp;D, with 10 being the equivalent of
no armor, and lower numbers meaning better armor. Each suit of armor
which exists in AD&amp;D gives the same protection in NetHack.</p>
<p>Here is a list of the armor class values provided by suits of
armor:</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 42%" />
<col style="width: 57%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Dragon scale mail</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Plate mail, Crystal plate mail</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bronze plate mail, Splint mail, Banded mail, Dwarvish
mithril-coat</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Chain mail, Elven mithril-coat</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Scale mail, Orcish chain mail</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">6</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ring mail, Studded leather armor, Dragon scales</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">7</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Leather armor, Orcish ring mail</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">8</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Leather jacket</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">9</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>none</code></td>
<td style="text-align: right;">10</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>You can also wear other pieces of armor (cloak over suit, shirt under
suit, helmet, gloves, boots, shield) to lower your armor class even
further. Most of these provide a one or two point improvement to AC
(making the overall value smaller and eventually negative) but can also
be enchanted. Shirts are an exception; they don’t provide any protection
unless enchanted. Some cloaks also don’t improve AC when unenchanted but
all cloaks offer some protection against rust or corrosion to suits worn
under them and against some monster <em>touch</em> attacks.</p>
<p>If a piece of armor is enchanted, its armor protection will be better
(or worse) than normal, and its <code>plus</code> (or minus) will
subtract from your armor class. For example, a +1 chain mail would give
you better protection than normal chain mail, lowering your armor class
one unit further to 4. When you put on a piece of armor, you immediately
find out the armor class and any <code>plusses</code> it provides.
Cursed pieces of armor usually have negative enchantments (minuses) in
addition to being unremovable.</p>
<p>Many types of armor are subject to some kind of damage like rust.
Such damage can be repaired. Some types of armor may inhibit spell
casting.</p>
<p>The <code>nudist</code> option can be set (prior to game start) to
attempt to play the entire game without wearing any armor (a
self-imposed challenge which is extremely difficult to accomplish).</p>
<p>The commands to use armor are <code>W</code> (wear) and
<code>T</code> (take off). The <code>A</code> command can be used to
take off armor as well as other worn items. Also, <code>P</code> (put
on) and <code>R</code> (remove) which are normally for accessories can
be used for armor, but pieces of armor won’t be shown as likely
candidates in a prompt for choosing what to put on or remove.</p>
</section>
<section id="food" class="level3">
<h3>7.6. Food (<code>%</code>)</h3>
<p>Food is necessary to survive. If you go too long without eating you
will faint, and eventually die of starvation. Some types of food will
spoil, and become unhealthy to eat, if not protected. Food stored in ice
boxes or tins (<code>cans</code>) will usually stay fresh, but ice boxes
are heavy, and tins take a while to open.</p>
<p>When you kill monsters, they usually leave corpses which are also
<code>food.</code> Many, but not all, of these are edible; some also
give you special powers when you eat them. A good rule of thumb is “you
are what you eat.”</p>
<p>Some character roles and some monsters are vegetarian. Vegetarian
monsters will typically never eat animal corpses, while vegetarian
players can, but with some rather unpleasant side-effects.</p>
<p>You can name one food item after something you like to eat with the
<code>fruit</code> option.</p>
<p>The command to eat food is <code>e</code>.</p>
</section>
<section id="scrolls" class="level3">
<h3>7.7. Scrolls (<code>?</code>)</h3>
<p>Scrolls are labeled with various titles, probably chosen by ancient
wizards for their amusement value (for example <code>READ ME,</code> or
<code>THANX MAUD</code> backwards). Scrolls disappear after you read
them (except for blank ones, without magic spells on them).</p>
<p>One of the most useful of these is the <em>scroll of identify</em>,
which can be used to determine what another object is, whether it is
cursed or blessed, and how many uses it has left. Some objects of subtle
enchantment are difficult to identify without these.</p>
<p>A scroll whose label is known can be read even when the hero is
blind. If a scroll has been discovered, it will be listed in inventory
by type rather than by label, but the label is known in that situation
even though it isn’t shown.</p>
<p>Many scrolls produce a different effect from usual if they are
blessed or cursed, or read while the hero is confused.</p>
<p>A mail daemon may run up and deliver mail to you as a <em>scroll of
mail</em> (on versions compiled with this feature). To use this feature
on versions where NetHack mail delivery is triggered by electronic mail
appearing in your system mailbox, you must let NetHack know where to
look for new mail by setting the <code>MAIL</code> environment variable
to the file name of your mailbox. You may also want to set the
<code>MAILREADER</code> environment variable to the file name of your
favorite reader, so NetHack can shell to it when you read the scroll. On
versions of NetHack where mail is randomly generated internal to the
game, these environment variables are ignored. You can disable the mail
daemon by turning off the <code>mail</code> option.</p>
<p>The command to read a scroll is <code>r</code>.</p>
</section>
<section id="potions" class="level3">
<h3>7.8. Potions (<code>!</code>)</h3>
<p>Potions are distinguished by the color of the liquid inside the
flask. They disappear after you quaff them.</p>
<p>Clear potions are potions of water. Sometimes these are blessed or
cursed, resulting in holy or unholy water. Holy water is the bane of the
undead, so potions of holy water are good things to throw
(<code>t</code>) at them. It is also sometimes very useful to dip
(<code>#dip</code>) an object into a potion.</p>
<p>The command to drink a potion is <code>q</code> (quaff).</p>
</section>
<section id="wands" class="level3">
<h3>7.9. Wands (<code>/</code>)</h3>
<p>Wands usually have multiple magical charges. Some types of wands
require a direction in which to zap them. You can also zap them at
yourself (just give a <code>.</code> or <code>s</code> for the
direction). Be warned, however, for this is often unwise. Other types of
wands don’t require a direction. The number of charges in a wand is
random and decreases by one whenever you use it.</p>
<p>When the number of charges left in a wand becomes zero, attempts to
use the wand will usually result in nothing happening. Occasionally,
however, it may be possible to squeeze the last few mana points from an
otherwise spent wand, destroying it in the process. A wand may be
recharged by using suitable magic, but doing so runs the risk of causing
it to explode. The chance for such an explosion starts out very small
and increases each time the wand is recharged.</p>
<p>In a truly desperate situation, when your back is up against the
wall, you might decide to go for broke and break your wand. This is not
for the faint of heart. Doing so will almost certainly cause a
catastrophic release of magical energies.</p>
<p>When you have fully identified a particular wand, inventory display
will include additional information in parentheses: the number of times
it has been recharged followed by a colon and then by its current number
of charges. A current charge count of -1 is a special case indicating
that the wand has been cancelled.</p>
<p>The command to use a wand is <code>z</code> (zap). To break one, use
the <code>a</code> (apply) command.</p>
</section>
<section id="rings" class="level3">
<h3>7.10. Rings (<code>=</code>)</h3>
<p>Rings are very useful items, since they are relatively permanent
magic, unlike the usually fleeting effects of potions, scrolls, and
wands.</p>
<p>Putting on a ring activates its magic. You can wear at most two rings
at any time, one on the ring finger of each hand.</p>
<p>Most worn rings also cause you to grow hungry more rapidly, the rate
varying with the type of ring.</p>
<p>When wearing gloves, rings are worn underneath. If the gloves are
cursed, rings cannot be put on and any already being worn cannot be
removed. When worn gloves aren’t cursed, you don’t have to manually take
them off before putting on or removing a ring and then re-wear them
after. That’s done implicitly to avoid unnecessary tedium.</p>
<p>The commands to use rings are <code>P</code> (put on) and
<code>R</code> (remove). <code>A</code>, <code>W</code>, and
<code>T</code> can also be used; see <em>Amulets</em>.</p>
</section>
<section id="spellbooks" class="level3">
<h3>7.11. Spellbooks (<code>+</code>)</h3>
<p>Spellbooks are tomes of mighty magic. When studied with the
<code>r</code> (read) command, they transfer to the reader the knowledge
of a spell (and therefore eventually become unreadable)—unless the
attempt backfires. Reading a cursed spellbook or one with mystic runes
beyond your ken can be harmful to your health!</p>
<p>A spell (even when learned) can also backfire when you cast it. If
you attempt to cast a spell well above your experience level, or if you
have little skill with the appropriate spell type, or cast it at a time
when your luck is particularly bad, you can end up wasting both the
energy and the time required in casting.</p>
<p>Casting a spell calls forth magical energies and focuses them with
your naked mind. Some of the magical energy released comes from within
you. Casting temporarily drains your magical power, which will slowly be
recovered, and causes you to need additional food. Casting of spells
also requires practice. With practice, your skill in each category of
spell casting will improve. Over time, however, your memory of each
spell will dim, and you will need to relearn it.</p>
<p>Some spells require a direction in which to cast them, similar to
wands. To cast one at yourself, just give a <code>.</code> or
<code>s</code> for the direction. A few spells require you to pick a
target location rather than just specify a particular direction. Other
spells don’t require any direction or target.</p>
<p>Just as weapons are divided into groups in which a character can
become proficient (to varying degrees), spells are similarly grouped.
Successfully casting a spell exercises its skill group; using the
<code>#enhance</code> command to advance a sufficiently exercised skill
will affect all spells within the group. Advanced skill may increase the
potency of spells, reduce their risk of failure during casting attempts,
and improve the accuracy of the estimate for how much longer they will
be retained in your memory. Skill slots are shared with weapons skills.
(See also the section on “Weapon proficiency”.)</p>
<p>Casting a spell also requires flexible movement, and wearing various
types of armor may interfere with that.</p>
<p>The command to read a spellbook is the same as for scrolls,
<code>r</code> (read). The <code>+</code> command lists each spell you
know along with its level, skill category, chance of failure when
casting, and an estimate of how strongly it is remembered. The
<code>Z</code> (cast) command casts a spell.</p>
</section>
<section id="tools" class="level3">
<h3>7.12. Tools (<code>(</code>)</h3>
<p>Tools are miscellaneous objects with various purposes. Some tools
have a limited number of uses, akin to wand charges. For example, lamps
burn out after a while. Other tools are containers, which objects can be
placed into or taken out of.</p>
<p>Some tools (such as a blindfold) can be <em>worn</em> and can be put
on and removed like other accessories (rings, amulets); see
<em>Amulets</em>. Other tools (such as pick-axe) can be wielded as
weapons in addition to being applied for their usual purpose, and in
some cases (again, pick-axe) become wielded as a weapon even when
applied.</p>
<p>The <code>blind</code> option can be set (prior to game start) to
attempt to play the entire game without being able to see (a
self-imposed challenge which is very difficult to accomplish).</p>
<p>The command to use a tool is <code>a</code> (apply).</p>
<section id="containers" class="level4">
<h4>7.12.1. Containers</h4>
<p>You may encounter bags, boxes, and chests in your travels. A tool of
this sort can be opened with the <code>#loot</code> extended command
when you are standing on top of it (that is, on the same floor spot), or
with the <code>a</code> (apply) command when you are carrying it.
However, chests are often locked, and are in any case unwieldy objects.
You must set one down before unlocking it by using a key or lock-picking
tool with the <code>a</code> (apply) command, by kicking it with the
<code>^D</code> command, or by using a weapon to force the lock with the
<code>#force</code> extended command.</p>
<p>Some chests are trapped, causing nasty things to happen when you
unlock or open them. You can check for and try to deactivate traps with
the <code>#untrap</code> extended command.</p>
<p>When the contents of a container are known, that container will be
described as something like “a sack containing 3 items”. In this
example, the 3 refers to number of <em>stacks</em> of compatible items,
not to the total number of individual items. So a sack holding 2 sky
blue potions, 7 arrows, and 350 gold pieces would be described as having
3 items rather than 10 or 359. And you would need to have 3 unused
inventory slots available in order to take everything out (for the case
where the items you remove don’t combine into bigger stacks with things
you’re already carrying).</p>
<p>If a chest or large box is described as <code>broken</code>, that
means that it can’t be locked rather than that it no longer functions as
a container.</p>
<p>The <em>apply</em> and <em>loot</em> commands allow you to take out
and/or put in an arbitrary number of items in a single operation. If you
want to take everything out of a container, you can use the
<code>#tip</code> command to pour the contents onto the floor. This may
be your only way to get things out if your hands are stuck to a cursed
two-handed weapon. When your hands aren’t stuck, you have the potential
to pour the contents into another container. (As of this writing, the
other container must be carried rather than on the floor.)</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="amulets" class="level3">
<h3>7.13. Amulets (<code>"</code>)</h3>
<p>Amulets are very similar to rings, and often more powerful. Like
rings, amulets have various magical properties, some beneficial, some
harmful, which are activated by putting them on.</p>
<p>Only one amulet may be worn at a time, around your neck. Like wearing
rings, wearing an amulet affects your metabolism, causing you to grow
hungry more rapidly.</p>
<p>The commands to use amulets are the same as for rings, <code>P</code>
(put on) and <code>R</code> (remove). <code>A</code> can be used to
remove various worn items including amulets. Also, <code>W</code> (wear)
and <code>T</code> (take off) which are normally for armor can be used
for amulets and other accessories (rings and eyewear), but accessories
won’t be shown as likely candidates in a prompt for choosing what to
wear or take off.</p>
</section>
<section id="gems" class="level3">
<h3>7.14. Gems (<code>*</code>)</h3>
<p>Some gems are valuable, and can be sold for a lot of gold. They are
also a far more efficient way of carrying your riches. Valuable gems
increase your score if you bring them with you when you exit.</p>
<p>Other small rocks are also categorized as gems, but they are much
less valuable. All rocks, however, can be used as projectile weapons (if
you have a sling). In the most desperate of cases, you can still throw
them by hand.</p>
</section>
<section id="large-rocks" class="level3">
<h3>7.15. Large rocks (<code>`</code>)</h3>
<p>Statues and boulders are not particularly useful, and are generally
heavy. It is rumored that some statues are not what they seem.</p>
<p>Boulders occasionally block your path. You can push one forward (by
attempting to walk onto its spot) when nothing blocks <em>its</em> path,
or you can smash it into a pile of small rocks with breaking magic or a
pick-axe. It is possible to move onto a boulder’s location if certain
conditions are met; ordinarily one of those conditions is that pushing
it any further be blocked. Using the move-without-picking-up prefix
(default key ‘<code>m</code>’) prior to the direction of movement will
attempt to move to a boulder’s location without pushing it in addition
to the prefix’s usual action of suppressing auto-pickup at the
destination.</p>
<p>Very large humanoids (giants and their ilk) have been known to pick
up boulders and use them as missile weapons.</p>
<p>Unlike boulders, statues can’t be pushed, but don’t need to be
because they don’t block movement. They can be smashed into rocks
though.</p>
<p>For some configurations of the program, statues are no longer shown
as ‘<code>`</code>’ but by the letter representing the monster they
depict instead.</p>
</section>
<section id="gold" class="level3">
<h3>7.16. Gold (<code>$</code>)</h3>
<p>Gold adds to your score, and you can buy things in shops with it.
There are a number of monsters in the dungeon that may be influenced by
the amount of gold you are carrying (shopkeepers aside).</p>
<p>Gold pieces are the only type of object where bless/curse state does
not apply. They’re always uncursed but never described as uncursed even
if you turn off the <code>implicit_uncursed</code> option. You can set
the <code>goldX</code> option if you prefer to have gold pieces be
treated as bless/curse state <em>unknown</em> rather than as known to be
uncursed. Only matters when you’re using an object selection prompt that
can filter by “<code>BUCX</code>” state.</p>
</section>
<section id="persistence-of-objects" class="level3">
<h3>7.17. Persistence of Objects</h3>
<p>Normally, if you have seen an object at a particular map location and
move to another location where you can’t directly see that object any
more, it will continue to be displayed on your map. That remains the
case even if it is not actually there any more—perhaps a monster has
picked it up or it has rotted away—until you can see or feel that
location again. One notable exception is that if the object gets covered
by the “remembered, unseen monster” marker. When that marker is later
removed after you’ve verified that no monster is there, you will have
forgotten that there was any object there regardless of whether the
unseen monster actually took the object. If the object is still there,
then once you see or feel that location again you will re-discover the
object and resume remembering it.</p>
<p>The situation is the same for a pile of objects, except that only the
top item of the pile is displayed. The <code>hilite_pile</code> option
can be enabled in order to show an item differently when it is the top
one of a pile.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="conduct" class="level2">
<h2>8. Conduct</h2>
<p>As if winning NetHack were not difficult enough, certain players seek
to challenge themselves by imposing restrictions on the way they play
the game. The game automatically tracks some of these challenges, which
can be checked at any time with the #conduct command or at the end of
the game. When you perform an action which breaks a challenge, it will
no longer be listed. This gives players extra
<code>bragging rights</code> for winning the game with these challenges.
Note that it is perfectly acceptable to win the game without resorting
to these restrictions and that it is unusual for players to adhere to
challenges the first time they win the game.</p>
<p>Several of the challenges are related to eating behavior. The most
difficult of these is the foodless challenge. Although creatures can
survive long periods of time without food, there is a physiological need
for water; thus there is no restriction on drinking beverages, even if
they provide some minor food benefits. Calling upon your god for help
with starvation does not violate any food challenges either.</p>
<p>A strict vegan diet is one which avoids any food derived from
animals. The primary source of nutrition is fruits and vegetables. The
corpses and tins of blobs (<code>b</code>), jellies (<code>j</code>),
and fungi (<code>F</code>) are also considered to be vegetable matter.
Certain human food is prepared without animal products; namely, lembas
wafers, cram rations, food rations (gunyoki), K-rations, and C-rations.
Metal or another normally indigestible material eaten while polymorphed
into a creature that can digest it is also considered vegan food. Note
however that eating such items still counts against foodless
conduct.</p>
<p>Vegetarians do not eat animals; however, they are less selective
about eating animal byproducts than vegans. In addition to the vegan
items listed above, they may eat any kind of pudding (<code>P</code>)
other than the black puddings, eggs and food made from eggs (fortune
cookies and pancakes), food made with milk (cream pies and candy bars),
and lumps of royal jelly. Monks are expected to observe a vegetarian
diet.</p>
<p>Eating any kind of meat violates the vegetarian, vegan, and foodless
conducts. This includes tripe rations, the corpses or tins of any
monsters not mentioned above, and the various other chunks of meat found
in the dungeon. Swallowing and digesting a monster while polymorphed is
treated as if you ate the creature’s corpse. Eating leather, dragon
hide, or bone items while polymorphed into a creature that can digest
it, or eating monster brains while polymorphed into a mind flayer, is
considered eating an animal, although wax is only an animal
byproduct.</p>
<p>Regardless of conduct, there will be some items which are
indigestible, and others which are hazardous to eat. Using a
swallow-and-digest attack against a monster is equivalent to eating the
monster’s corpse. Please note that the term <code>vegan</code> is used
here only in the context of diet. You are still free to choose not to
use or wear items derived from animals (e.g. leather, dragon hide, bone,
horns, coral), but the game will not keep track of this for you. Also
note that <code>milky</code> potions may be a translucent white, but
they do not contain milk, so they are compatible with a vegan diet.
Slime molds or player-defined <code>fruits</code>, although they could
be anything from <code>cherries</code> to <code>pork chops</code>, are
also assumed to be vegan.</p>
<p>An atheist is one who rejects religion. This means that you cannot
#pray, #offer sacrifices to any god, #turn undead, or #chat with a
priest. Particularly selective readers may argue that playing Monk or
Priest characters should violate this conduct; that is a choice left to
the player. Offering the Amulet of Yendor to your god is necessary to
win the game and is not counted against this conduct. You are also not
penalized for being spoken to by an angry god, priest(ess), or other
religious figure; a true atheist would hear the words but attach no
special meaning to them.</p>
<p>Most players fight with a wielded weapon (or tool intended to be
wielded as a weapon). Another challenge is to win the game without using
such a wielded weapon. You are still permitted to throw, fire, and kick
weapons; use a wand, spell, or other type of item; or fight with your
hands and feet.</p>
<p>In NetHack, a pacifist refuses to cause the death of any other
monster (i.e. if you would get experience for the death). This is a
particularly difficult challenge, although it is still possible to gain
experience by other means.</p>
<p>An illiterate character does not read or write. This includes reading
a scroll, spellbook, fortune cookie message, or t-shirt; writing a
scroll; or making an engraving of anything other than a single
<code>X</code> (the traditional signature of an illiterate person).
Reading an engraving, or any item that is absolutely necessary to win
the game, is not counted against this conduct. The identity of scrolls
and spellbooks (and knowledge of spells) in your starting inventory is
assumed to be learned from your teachers prior to the start of the game
and isn’t counted.</p>
<p>There is a side-branch to the main dungeon called
<code>Sokoban,</code> briefly described in the earlier section about
<em>Traps</em>. As mentioned there, the goal is to push boulders into
pits and/or holes to plug those in order to both get the boulders out of
the way and be able to go past the traps. There are some special
<code>rules</code> that are active when in that branch of the dungeon.
Some rules can’t be bypassed, such as being unable to push a boulder
diagonally. Other rules can, such as not smashing boulders with magic or
tools, but doing so causes you to receive a luck penalty. No message
about that is given at the time, but it is tracked as a conduct. The
#conduct command and end of game disclosure will report whether you have
abided by the special rules of Sokoban, and if not, how many times you
violated them, providing you with a way to discover which actions incur
bad luck so that you can be better informed about whether or not to
avoid repeating those actions in the future. (Note: the Sokoban conduct
will only be displayed if you have entered the Sokoban branch of the
dungeon during the current game. Once that has happened, it becomes part
of disclosed conduct even if you haven’t done anything interesting
there. Ending the game with “never broke the Sokoban rules” conduct is
most meaningful if you also manage to perform the “obtained the Sokoban
prize” achievement (see <em>Achievements</em> below).)</p>
<p>There are several other challenges tracked by the game. It is
possible to eliminate one or more species of monsters by genocide;
playing without this feature is considered a challenge. When the game
offers you an opportunity to genocide monsters, you may respond with the
monster type <code>none</code> if you want to decline. You can change
the form of an item into another item of the same type
(<code>polypiling</code>) or the form of your own body into another
creature (<code>polyself</code>) by wand, spell, or potion of polymorph;
avoiding these effects are each considered challenges. Polymorphing
monsters, including pets, does not break either of these challenges.
Finally, you may sometimes receive wishes; a game without an attempt to
wish for any items is a challenge, as is a game without wishing for an
artifact (even if the artifact immediately disappears). When the game
offers you an opportunity to make a wish for an item, you may choose
<code>nothing</code> if you want to decline.</p>
<section id="achievements" class="level3">
<h3>8.1. Achievements</h3>
<p>End of game disclosure will also display various achievements
representing progress toward ultimate ascension, if any have been
attained. They aren’t directly related to <em>conduct</em> but are
grouped with it because they fall into the same category of
<code>bragging rights</code> and to limit the number of questions during
disclosure. Listed here roughly in order of difficulty and not
necessarily in the order in which you might accomplish them.</p>

<p><code>Notes:</code></p>
<p>Achievements are recorded and subsequently reported in the order in
which they happen during your current game rather than the order listed
here.</p>
<p>There are nine <em><code>&lt;Rank&gt;</code></em> titles for each
role, bestowed at experience levels 1, 3, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, 26, and 30.
The one for experience level 1 is not recorded as an achievement. Losing
enough levels to revert to lower rank(s) does not discard the
corresponding achievement(s).</p>
<p>There’s no guaranteed <em>Novel</em> so the achievement to read one
might not always be attainable (except perhaps by <em>wishing</em>).
Similarly, the <em>Big Room</em> level is not always present. Unlike
with the Novel, there’s no way to wish for this opportunity.</p>
<p>The <code>special items</code> hidden in <em>Mines’ End</em> and
<em>Sokoban</em> are not unique but are considered to be prizes or
rewards for exploring those levels since doing so is not necessary to
complete the game. Finding other instances of the same objects doesn’t
record the corresponding achievement.</p>
<p>The <em>Medusa</em> achievement is recorded if she dies for any
reason, even if you are not directly responsible, and only if she
dies.</p>
<p>The 5-note <em>tune</em> can be learned via trial and error with a
musical instrument played closely enough—but not too close!—to the
Castle level’s drawbridge or can be given to you via prayer boon.</p>
<p><em>Blind</em>, <em>Deaf</em>, <em>Nudist</em>, and <em>Pauper</em>
are also conducts, and they can only be enabled by setting the
correspondingly named option in NETHACKOPTIONS or run-time configuration
file prior to game start. In the case of <em>Blind</em> and
<em>Deaf</em>, the option also enforces the conduct. They aren’t really
significant accomplishments unless/until you make substantial progress
into the dungeon.</p>

<h3>9.5. Saving and restoring</h3>
<p><strong>Saving (<code>S</code>)</strong></p>
<p>Press <code>S</code> to save your game and quit. The game state is
written to localStorage and you’ll see confirmation before the page
reloads.</p>
<p>The game also auto-saves periodically, so closing the browser tab
won’t lose progress. However, <code>S</code> ensures a clean save
point.</p>
<p><strong>Restoring</strong></p>
<p>When you return to the game, it automatically detects your save and
asks whether to restore. Your game resumes exactly where you left off,
including the random number generator state for full determinism.</p>
<p><strong>Bones Files</strong></p>
<p>When you die, your ghost and possessions may be saved as a “bones
file.” Future characters exploring that dungeon depth may encounter your
remains — and your vengeful ghost.</p>

<section id="scoring" class="level2">
<h2>10. Scoring</h2>
<p>NetHack maintains a list of the top scores or scorers on your
machine, depending on how it is set up. In the latter case, each account
on the machine can post only one non-winning score on this list. If you
score higher than someone else on this list, or better your previous
score, you will be inserted in the proper place under your current name.
How many scores are kept can also be set up when NetHack is
compiled.</p>
<p>Your score is chiefly based upon how much experience you gained, how
much loot you accumulated, how deep you explored, and how the game
ended. If you quit the game, you escape with all of your gold intact.
If, however, you get killed in the Mazes of Menace, the guild will only
hear about 90% of your gold when your corpse is discovered (adventurers
have been known to collect finder’s fees). So, consider whether you want
to take one last hit at that monster and possibly live, or quit and stop
with whatever you have. If you quit, you keep all your gold, but if you
swing and live, you might find more.</p>
<p>If you just want to see what the current top players/games list is,
you can type <strong>nethack -s all</strong> on most versions.</p>
</section>
<section id="explore-mode" class="level2">
<h2>11. Explore mode</h2>
<p>NetHack is an intricate and difficult game. Novices might falter in
fear, aware of their ignorance of the means to survive. Well, fear not.
Your dungeon comes equipped with an <code>explore</code> or
<code>discovery</code> mode that enables you to keep old save files and
cheat death, at the paltry cost of not getting on the high score
list.</p>
<p>There are two ways of enabling explore mode. One is to start the game
with the <code>-X</code> command-line switch or with the
<code>playmode:explore</code> option. The other is to issue the
<code>#exploremode</code> extended command while already playing the
game. Starting a new game in explore mode provides your character with a
wand of wishing in initial inventory; switching during play does not.
The other benefits of explore mode are left for the trepid reader to
discover.</p>
<section id="debug-mode" class="level3">
<h3>11.1. Debug mode</h3>
<p>Debug mode, also known as wizard mode, is undocumented aside from
this brief description and the various <code>debug mode only</code>
commands listed among the command descriptions. It is intended for
tracking down problems within the program rather than to provide
god-like powers to your character, and players who attempt debugging are
expected to figure out how to use it themselves. It is initiated by
starting the game with the <code>-D</code> command-line switch or with
the <code>playmode:debug</code> option.</p>
<p>For some systems, the player must be logged in under a particular
user name to be allowed to use debug mode; for others, the hero must be
given a particular character name (but may be any role; there’s no
connection between <code>wizard mode</code> and the Wizard role).
Attempting to start a game in debug mode when not allowed or not
available will result in falling back to explore mode instead.</p>

<h2>12. Credits</h2>
<p>The original <em>hack</em> game was modeled on the Berkeley UNIX
<em>rogue</em> game. Large portions of this document were shamelessly
cribbed from <em>A Guide to the Dungeons of Doom</em>, by Michael C. Toy
and Kenneth C. R. C. Arnold. Small portions were adapted from
<em>Further Exploration of the Dungeons of Doom</em>, by Ken
Arromdee.</p>
<p>NetHack is the product of literally scores of people’s work. Main
events in the course of the game development are described below:</p>
<p><strong>Jay Fenlason</strong> wrote the original Hack, with help from
<strong>Kenny Woodland</strong>, <strong>Mike Thome</strong>, and
<strong>Jon Payne</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Andries Brouwer</strong> did a major re-write while at
Stichting Mathematisch Centrum (now Centrum Wiskunde &amp; Informatica),
transforming Hack into a very different game. He published the Hack
source code for use on UNIX systems by posting that to Usenet newsgroup
<em>net.sources</em> (later renamed <em>comp.sources</em>) releasing
version 1.0 in December of 1984, then versions 1.0.1, 1.0.2, and finally
1.0.3 in July of 1985. Usenet newsgroup <em>net.games.hack</em> (later
renamed <em>rec.games.hack</em>, eventually replaced by
<em>rec.games.roguelike.nethack</em>) was created for discussing it.</p>
<p><strong>Don G. Kneller</strong> ported Hack 1.0.3 to Microsoft C and
MS-DOS, producing PC HACK 1.01e, added support for DEC Rainbow graphics
in version 1.03g, and went on to produce at least four more versions
(3.0, 3.2, 3.51, and 3.6; note that these are old Hack version numbers,
not contemporary NetHack ones).</p>
<p><strong>R. Black</strong> ported PC HACK 3.51 to Lattice C and the
Atari 520/1040ST, producing ST Hack 1.03.</p>
<p><strong>Mike Stephenson</strong> merged these various versions back
together, incorporating many of the added features, and produced NetHack
version 1.4 in 1987. He then coordinated a cast of thousands in
enhancing and debugging NetHack 1.4 and released NetHack versions 2.2
and 2.3. Like Hack, they were released by posting their source code to
Usenet where they remained available in various archives accessible via
<em>ftp</em> and <em>uucp</em> after expiring from the newsgroup.</p>
<p>Later, Mike coordinated a major re-write of the game, heading a team
which included <strong>Ken Arromdee</strong>, <strong>Jean-Christophe
Collet</strong>, <strong>Steve Creps</strong>, <strong>Eric
Hendrickson</strong>, <strong>Izchak Miller</strong>, <strong>Eric S.
Raymond</strong>, <strong>John Rupley</strong>, <strong>Mike
Threepoint</strong>, and <strong>Janet Walz</strong>, to produce NetHack
3.0c.</p>
<p>NetHack 3.0 was ported to the Atari by <strong>Eric R.
Smith</strong>, to OS/2 by <strong>Timo Hakulinen</strong>, and to VMS
by <strong>David Gentzel</strong>. The three of them and <strong>Kevin
Darcy</strong> later joined the main NetHack Development Team to produce
subsequent revisions of 3.0.</p>
<p><strong>Olaf Seibert</strong> ported NetHack 2.3 and 3.0 to the
Amiga. <strong>Norm Meluch</strong>, <strong>Stephen Spackman</strong>
and <strong>Pierre Martineau</strong> designed overlay code for PC
NetHack 3.0. <strong>Johnny Lee</strong> ported NetHack 3.0 to the
Macintosh. Along with various other Dungeoneers, they continued to
enhance the PC, Macintosh, and Amiga ports through the later revisions
of 3.0.</p>
<p>Version 3.0 went through ten relatively rapidly released
<code>patch-level</code> revisions. Versions at the time were known as
3.0 for the base release and variously as <code>3.0a</code> through
<code>3.0j</code>, <code>3.0 patchlevel 1</code> through
<code>3.0 patchlevel 10</code>, or <code>3.0pl1</code> through
<code>3.0pl10</code> rather than 3.0.0 and 3.0.1 through 3.0.10; the
three component numbering scheme began to be used with 3.1.0.</p>
<p>Headed by <strong>Mike Stephenson</strong> and coordinated by
<strong>Izchak Miller</strong> and <strong>Janet Walz</strong>, the
NetHack Development Team which now included <strong>Ken
Arromdee</strong>, <strong>David Cohrs</strong>, <strong>Jean-Christophe
Collet</strong>, <strong>Kevin Darcy</strong>, <strong>Matt
Day</strong>, <strong>Timo Hakulinen</strong>, <strong>Steve
Linhart</strong>, <strong>Dean Luick</strong>, <strong>Pat
Rankin</strong>, <strong>Eric Raymond</strong>, and <strong>Eric
Smith</strong> undertook a radical revision of 3.0. They re-structured
the game’s design, and re-wrote major parts of the code. They added
multiple dungeons, a new display, special individual character quests, a
new endgame and many other new features, and produced NetHack 3.1.
Version 3.1.0 was released in January of 1993.</p>
<p><strong>Ken Lorber</strong>, <strong>Gregg Wonderly</strong> and
<strong>Greg Olson</strong>, with help from <strong>Richard
Addison</strong>, <strong>Mike Passaretti</strong>, and <strong>Olaf
Seibert</strong>, developed NetHack 3.1 for the Amiga.</p>
<p><strong>Norm Meluch</strong> and <strong>Kevin Smolkowski</strong>,
with help from <strong>Carl Schelin</strong>, <strong>Stephen
Spackman</strong>, <strong>Steve VanDevender</strong>, and <strong>Paul
Winner</strong>, ported NetHack 3.1 to the PC.</p>
<p><strong>Jon Wätte</strong> and <strong>Hao-yang Wang</strong>, with
help from <strong>Ross Brown</strong>, <strong>Mike Engber</strong>,
<strong>David Hairston</strong>, <strong>Michael Hamel</strong>,
<strong>Jonathan Handler</strong>, <strong>Johnny Lee</strong>,
<strong>Tim Lennan</strong>, <strong>Rob Menke</strong>, and
<strong>Andy Swanson</strong>, developed NetHack 3.1 for the Macintosh,
porting it for MPW. Building on their development, <strong>Bart
House</strong> added a Think C port.</p>
<p><strong>Timo Hakulinen</strong> ported NetHack 3.1 to OS/2.
<strong>Eric Smith</strong> ported NetHack 3.1 to the Atari. <strong>Pat
Rankin</strong>, with help from <strong>Joshua Delahunty</strong>, was
responsible for the VMS version of NetHack 3.1. <strong>Michael
Allison</strong> ported NetHack 3.1 to Windows NT.</p>
<p><strong>Dean Luick</strong>, with help from <strong>David
Cohrs</strong>, developed NetHack 3.1 for X11. It drew the map as text
rather than graphically but included <code>nh10.bdf</code>, an
optionally used custom X11 font which has tiny images in place of
letters and punctuation, a precursor of tiles. Those images don’t extend
to individual monster and object types, just replacements for monster
and object classes (so one custom image for all “<code>a</code>” insects
and another for all “<code>[</code>” armor and so forth, not separate
images for beetles and ants or for cloaks and boots).</p>
<p><strong>Warwick Allison</strong> wrote a graphically displayed
version of NetHack for the Atari where the tiny pictures were described
as <code>icons</code> and were distinct for specific types of monsters
and objects rather than just their classes. He contributed them to the
<strong>NetHack Development Team</strong> which rechristened them
<code>tiles</code>, original usage which has subsequently been picked up
by various other games. NetHack’s tiles support was then implemented on
other platforms (initially MS-DOS but eventually Windows, Qt, and X11
too).</p>
<p>The 3.2 NetHack Development Team, comprised of <strong>Michael
Allison</strong>, <strong>Ken</strong> Arromdee, <strong>David
Cohrs</strong>, <strong>Jessie Collet</strong>, <strong>Steve
Creps</strong>, <strong>Kevin Darcy</strong>, <strong>Timo
Hakulinen</strong>, <strong>Steve Linhart</strong>,
<strong>Dean</strong> Luick, <strong>Pat Rankin</strong>, <strong>Eric
Smith</strong>, <strong>Mike Stephenson</strong>, <strong>Janet
Walz</strong>, and <strong>Paul Winner</strong>, released version 3.2.0
in April of 1996.</p>
<p>Version 3.2 marked the tenth anniversary of the formation of the
development team. In a testament to their dedication to the game, all
thirteen members of the original NetHack Development Team remained on
the team at the start of work on that release. During the interval
between the release of 3.1.3 and 3.2.0, one of the founding members of
the NetHack Development Team, <strong>Dr. Izchak Miller</strong>, was
diagnosed with cancer and passed away. That release of the game was
dedicated to him by the development and porting teams.</p>
<p>Version 3.2 proved to be more stable than previous versions. Many
bugs were fixed, abuses eliminated, and game features tuned for better
game play.</p>
<p>During the lifespan of NetHack 3.1 and 3.2, several enthusiasts of
the game added their own modifications to the game and made these
<code>variants</code> publicly available:</p>
<p><strong>Tom Proudfoot</strong> and <strong>Yuval Oren</strong>
created NetHack++, which was quickly renamed NetHack– when some people
incorrectly assumed that it was a conversion of the <em>C</em> source
code to <em>C++</em>. Working independently, <strong>Stephen
White</strong> wrote NetHack Plus. <strong>Tom Proudfoot</strong> later
merged NetHack Plus and his own NetHack– to produce SLASH. <strong>Larry
Stewart-Zerba</strong> and <strong>Warwick Allison</strong> improved the
spell casting system with the Wizard Patch. <strong>Warwick
Allison</strong> also ported NetHack to use the Qt interface.</p>
<p><strong>Warren Cheung</strong> combined SLASH with the Wizard Patch
to produce Slash’EM, and with the help of <strong>Kevin Hugo</strong>,
added more features. Kevin later joined the NetHack Development Team and
incorporated the best of these ideas into NetHack 3.3.</p>
<p>The final update to 3.2 was the bug fix release 3.2.3, which was
released simultaneously with 3.3.0 in December 1999 just in time for the
Year 2000. Because of the newer version, 3.2.3 was released as a source
code patch only, without any ready-to-play distribution for systems that
usually had such.</p>
<p>(To anyone considering resurrecting an old version: all versions
before 3.2.3 had a <em>Y2K</em> bug. The high scores file and the log
file contained dates which were formatted using a two-digit year, and
1999’s year 99 was followed by 2000’s year 100. That got written out
successfully but it unintentionally introduced an extra column in the
file layout which prevented score entries from being read back in
correctly, interfering with insertion of new high scores and with
retrieval of old character names to use for random ghost and statue
names in the current game.)</p>
<p>The 3.3 NetHack Development Team, consisting of <strong>Michael
Allison</strong>, <strong>Ken Arromdee</strong>, <strong>David
Cohrs</strong>, <strong>Jessie Collet</strong>, <strong>Steve
Creps</strong>, <strong>Kevin Darcy</strong>, <strong>Timo
Hakulinen</strong>, <strong>Kevin Hugo</strong>, <strong>Steve
Linhart</strong>, <strong>Ken Lorber</strong>, <strong>Dean
Luick</strong>, <strong>Pat Rankin</strong>, <strong>Eric
Smith</strong>, <strong>Mike Stephenson</strong>, <strong>Janet
Walz</strong>, and <strong>Paul Winner</strong>, released 3.3.0 in
December 1999 and 3.3.1 in August of 2000.</p>
<p>Version 3.3 offered many firsts. It was the first version to separate
race and profession. The Elf class was removed in preference to an elf
race, and the races of dwarves, gnomes, and orcs made their first
appearance in the game alongside the familiar human race. Monk and
Ranger roles joined Archeologists, Barbarians, Cavemen, Healers,
Knights, Priests, Rogues, Samurai, Tourists, Valkyries and of course,
Wizards. It was also the first version to allow you to ride a steed, and
was the first version to have a publicly available web-site listing all
the bugs that had been discovered. Despite that constantly growing bug
list, 3.3 proved stable enough to last for more than a year and a
half.</p>
<p>The 3.4 NetHack Development Team initially consisted of
<strong>Michael Allison</strong>, <strong>Ken Arromdee</strong>,
<strong>David Cohrs</strong>, <strong>Jessie Collet</strong>,
<strong>Kevin Hugo</strong>, <strong>Ken Lorber</strong>, <strong>Dean
Luick</strong>, <strong>Pat Rankin</strong>, <strong>Mike
Stephenson</strong>, <strong>Janet Walz</strong>, and <strong>Paul
Winner</strong>, with <strong>Warwick Allison</strong> joining just
before the release of NetHack 3.4.0 in March 2002.</p>
<p>As with version 3.3, various people contributed to the game as a
whole as well as supporting ports on the different platforms that
NetHack runs on:</p>
<p><strong>Pat Rankin</strong> maintained 3.4 for VMS.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Allison</strong> maintained NetHack 3.4 for the
MS-DOS platform. <strong>Paul Winner</strong> and <strong>Yitzhak
Sapir</strong> provided encouragement.</p>
<p><strong>Dean Luick</strong>, <strong>Mark Modrall</strong>, and
<strong>Kevin Hugo</strong> maintained and enhanced the Macintosh port
of 3.4.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Allison</strong>, <strong>David Cohrs</strong>,
<strong>Alex Kompel</strong>, <strong>Dion Nicolaas</strong>, and
<strong>Yitzhak Sapir</strong> maintained and enhanced 3.4 for the
Microsoft Windows platform. <strong>Alex Kompel</strong> contributed a
new graphical interface for the Windows port. <strong>Alex
Kompel</strong> also contributed a Windows CE port for 3.4.1.</p>
<p><strong>Ron Van Iwaarden</strong> was the sole maintainer of NetHack
for OS/2 the past several releases. Unfortunately Ron’s last OS/2
machine stopped working in early 2006. A great many thanks to Ron for
keeping NetHack alive on OS/2 all these years.</p>
<p><strong>Janne Salmijarvi</strong> and <strong>Teemu Suikki</strong>
maintained and enhanced the Amiga port of 3.4 after <strong>Janne
Salmijarvi</strong> resurrected it for 3.3.1.</p>
<p><strong>Christian <code>Marvin</code> Bressler</strong> maintained
3.4 for the Atari after he resurrected it for 3.3.1.</p>
<p>The release of NetHack 3.4.3 in December 2003 marked the beginning of
a long release hiatus. 3.4.3 proved to be a remarkably stable version
that provided continued enjoyment by the community for more than a
decade. The NetHack Development Team slowly and quietly continued to
work on the game behind the scenes during the tenure of 3.4.3. It was
during that same period that several new variants emerged within the
NetHack community. Notably sporkhack by <strong>Derek S. Ray</strong>,
unnethack by <strong>Patric Mueller</strong>, nitrohack and its
successors originally by <strong>Daniel Thaler</strong> and then by
<strong>Alex Smith</strong>, and Dynahack by <strong>Tung
Nguyen</strong>. Some of those variants continue to be developed,
maintained, and enjoyed by the community to this day.</p>
<p>In September 2014, an interim snapshot of the code under development
was released publicly by other parties. Since that code was a
work-in-progress and had not gone through the process of debugging it as
a suitable release, it was decided that the version numbers present on
that code snapshot would be retired and never used in an official
NetHack release. An announcement was posted on the NetHack Development
Team’s official <a href="https://nethack.org">nethack.org</a> website to
that effect, stating that there would never be a 3.4.4, 3.5, or 3.5.0
official release version.</p>
<p>In January 2015, preparation began for the release of NetHack
3.6.</p>
<p>At the beginning of development for what would eventually get
released as 3.6.0, the NetHack Development Team consisted of
<strong>Warwick Allison</strong>, <strong>Michael Allison</strong>,
<strong>Ken Arromdee</strong>, <strong>David Cohrs</strong>,
<strong>Jessie Collet</strong>, <strong>Ken Lorber</strong>,
<strong>Dean Luick</strong>, <strong>Pat Rankin</strong>, <strong>Mike
Stephenson</strong>, <strong>Janet Walz</strong>, and <strong>Paul
Winner</strong>. In early 2015, ahead of the release of 3.6.0, new
members <strong>Sean Hunt</strong>, <strong>Pasi Kallinen</strong>, and
<strong>Derek S. Ray</strong> joined the NetHack Development Team.</p>
<p>Near the end of the development of 3.6.0, one of the significant
inspirations for many of the humorous and fun features found in the
game, author Terry Pratchett, passed away. NetHack 3.6.0 introduced a
tribute to him.</p>
<p>3.6.0 was released in December 2015, and merged work done by the
development team since the release of 3.4.3 with some of the beloved
community patches. Many bugs were fixed and some code was
restructured.</p>
<p>The NetHack Development Team, as well as <strong>Steve
VanDevender</strong> and <strong>Kevin Smolkowski</strong>, ensured that
NetHack 3.6 continued to operate on various UNIX flavors and maintained
the X11 interface.</p>
<p><strong>Ken Lorber</strong>, <strong>Haoyang Wang</strong>,
<strong>Pat Rankin</strong>, and <strong>Dean Luick</strong> maintained
the port of NetHack 3.6 for MacOS.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Allison</strong>, <strong>David Cohrs</strong>,
<strong>Bart House</strong>, <strong>Pasi Kallinen</strong>,
<strong>Alex Kompel</strong>, <strong>Dion Nicolaas</strong>,
<strong>Derek S. Ray</strong> and <strong>Yitzhak Sapir</strong>
maintained the port of NetHack 3.6 for Microsoft Windows.</p>
<p><strong>Pat Rankin</strong> attempted to keep the VMS port running
for NetHack 3.6, hindered by limited access. <strong>Kevin
Smolkowski</strong> has updated and tested it for the most recent
version of OpenVMS (V8.4 as of this writing) on Alpha and Integrity (aka
Itanium aka IA64) but not VAX.</p>
<p><strong>Ray Chason</strong> resurrected the MS-DOS port for 3.6 and
contributed the necessary updates to the community at large.</p>
<p>In late April 2018, several hundred bug fixes for 3.6.0 and some new
features were assembled and released as NetHack 3.6.1. The NetHack
Development Team at the time of release of 3.6.1 consisted of
<strong>Warwick Allison</strong>, <strong>Michael Allison</strong>,
<strong>Ken Arromdee</strong>, <strong>David Cohrs</strong>,
<strong>Jessie Collet</strong>, <strong>Pasi Kallinen</strong>,
<strong>Ken Lorber</strong>, <strong>Dean Luick</strong>, <strong>Patric
Mueller</strong>, <strong>Pat Rankin</strong>, <strong>Derek S.
Ray</strong>, <strong>Alex Smith</strong>, <strong>Mike
Stephenson</strong>, <strong>Janet Walz</strong>, and <strong>Paul
Winner</strong>.</p>
<p>In early May 2019, another 320 bug fixes along with some enhancements
and the adopted curses window port, were released as 3.6.2.</p>
<p><strong>Bart House</strong>, who had contributed to the game as a
porting team participant for decades, joined the NetHack Development
Team in late May 2019.</p>
<p>NetHack 3.6.3 was released on December 5, 2019 containing over 190
bug fixes to NetHack 3.6.2.</p>
<p>NetHack 3.6.4 was released on December 18, 2019 containing a security
fix and a few bug fixes.</p>
<p>NetHack 3.6.5 was released on January 27, 2020 containing some
security fixes and a small number of bug fixes.</p>
<p>NetHack 3.6.6 was released on March 8, 2020 containing a security fix
and some bug fixes.</p>
<p>NetHack 3.6.7 was released on February 16, 2023 containing a security
fix and some bug fixes.</p>

<h3>12.3. Menace Edition (Royal Jelly)</h3>
<p>The Menace edition is a JavaScript port of NetHack 3.7, playable in
any modern web browser. It was created through <strong>vibe
coding</strong> — building software by collaborating with LLM coding
agents rather than writing every line by hand.</p>
<p><strong>David Bau</strong> assisted by <strong>Claude</strong> and
<strong>Codex</strong> vibe coding agents.</p>
<p><em>You hear a low buzzing.</em></p>
<p>This is the <strong>Royal Jelly</strong> — the sweet output of The
Hive.</p>
