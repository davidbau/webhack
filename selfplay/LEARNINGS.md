# Selfplay Learnings

## 2026-02-14 - Dlvl1 Dog Engagement Tweak (C NetHack)

- Change: in `selfplay/brain/danger.js`, treat lone adjacent `d` (dog) on Dlvl 1 as a fight target when HP >= 45%, instead of default passive/avoid behavior.
- Why: repeated early deaths were caused by dog pressure while yielding tempo/space.
- Validation gate: C runner, seeds `1..10`, `1200` turns, `key-delay=0`.
- Baseline: average depth `2.000`, survived `6/10`.
- Candidate: average depth `2.000`, survived `7/10`.
- Net: +1 survival with no depth regression.
