                       It is written in the Book of Odin:

                           After the Creation, the cruel god Moloch rebelled
                           against the authority of Marduk the Creator.
                           Moloch stole from Marduk the most powerful of all
                           the artifacts of the gods, the Amulet of Yendor,
                           and he hid it in the dark cavities of Gehennom, the
                           Under World, where he now lurks, and bides his time.

                       Your god Odin seeks to possess the Amulet, and with it
                       to gain deserved ascendance over the other gods.

                       You, a newly trained Stripling, have been heralded
                       from birth as the instrument of Odin.  You are destined
                       to recover the Amulet for your deity, or die in the
                       attempt.  Your hour of destiny has come.  For the sake
                       of us all:  Go bravely with Odin!
